1
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,994
Well, my dad was a farmer.

2
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,622
Like everybody else back then.

3
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,918
Of course, he didn't start that way.

4
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,135
Computer says you're too tight.

5
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,846
- Nah, I got this.
- Crossing the Straights.

6
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,017
- Shutting it down, Cooper.
- No!

7
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,937
- Shutting it all down.
- No, I need power up!

8
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,318
Dad?

9
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,368
Sorry, Murph. Go back to bed.

10
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,204
- I thought you were the ghost.
- No.

11
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,875
There are no such things as ghosts, babe.

12
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,210
Grandpa says you can get ghosts.

13
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:13,383
Maybe that's because Grandpa's close
to being one himself. Back to bed.

14
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,552
Were you dreaming about the crash?

15
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,264
Get your butt back in bed, Murph.

16
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,793
The wheat had died.

17
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,962
The blight came and we had to burn it.

18
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,591
And we still had corn.
We had acres of corn.

19
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,010
But mostly we had dust.

20
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,057
I guess I can't describe it.
It was just constant.

21
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,685
Just that steady blow...

22
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,103
...of dirt.

23
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,274
We wore little strips of sheet...

24
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,152
...sometimes over our nose and mouth...

25
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,822
...so that we wouldn't
breathe so much of it.

26
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,034
When we set the table,
we always set the plate...

27
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,121
...upside-down.
Glasses or cups, whatever it was...

28
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,455
...upside-down.

29
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,130
Shake a leg! Murph, get a move on!

30
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,758
Tom, 4:00 today, you and me in the barn,
Herbicide Resistance 101.

31
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,427
- Check?
- Yes, sir.

32
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,638
Not at the table, Murph.

33
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,224
Dad, can you fix this?

34
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,144
What the heck did you do...

35
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,478
- ...to my lander?
- Wasn't me.

36
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,522
Let me guess. It was your ghost?

37
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,024
It knocked it off.
It keeps knocking books off.

38
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,693
No such thing as ghosts, dumb-ass.

39
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,987
- Hey.
- I looked it up. It's called a poltergeist.

40
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,405
Dad, tell her.

41
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,490
Well, it's not very scientific, Murph.

42
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,993
You said science was about admitting
what we don't know.

43
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,328
- She's got you there.
- Hey.

44
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,997
Start looking after our stuff.

45
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,833
Coop.

46
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,796
All right, Murph, you want to talk science?

47
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:19,009
Don't tell me you're afraid of some ghost.
No, you got to go further.

48
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:22,345
You got to record the facts, analyze,
get to the how and the why...

49
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,432
...then present your conclusions. Deal?

50
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,517
- Deal.
- All right.

51
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,522
- Have a good day at school.
- Hold up.

52
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,150
Parent-teacher conferences. Parent.

53
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,277
Not grandparent.

54
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,364
Slow down, turbo!

55
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,827
- That's not a dust storm.
- Nelson's torching his whole crop.

56
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,370
Blight?

57
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,956
They're saying it's the
last harvest for okra.

58
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,792
Ever.

59
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,338
He should've planted corn
like the rest of us.

60
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,216
Now, be nice to that Miss Hanley.
She's single.

61
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,884
What's that supposed to mean?

62
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:04,179
Repopulating the earth.
Start pulling your weight, young man.

63
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:08,308
Why don't you start
minding your own business, old man?

64
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,275
All right, Murph, give me second.

65
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,072
Third.

66
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,283
- Find a gear, dumb-ass.
- Grind it!

67
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,493
Shut it, Tom!

68
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,205
- What'd you do, Murph?
- She didn't do nothing.

69
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,874
- Blew a tire is all.
- Murphy's Law.

70
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,043
Shut up!

71
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,962
- Grab the spare, Tom.
- That is the spare.

72
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,091
Get the patch kit!

73
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,595
- How am I supposed to patch it out here?
- You got to figure it out.

74
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,722
I'm not always gonna be here to help you.

75
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,899
What's going on, Murph?

76
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,278
Why did you and Mom name me
after something that's bad?

77
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,821
We didn't.

78
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,698
Murphy's Law?

79
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:09,744
Murphy's Law doesn't mean
that something bad will happen.

80
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,290
What it means is
whatever can happen will happen.

81
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,001
And that sounded just fine with us.

82
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,633
Get in.

83
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,428
Get in, let's go.

84
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,890
What about the flat tire?

85
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,185
Yeah.

86
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:52,162
It's an Indian Air Force drone.
Solar cells could power an entire farm.

87
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,788
Take the wheel, Tom.

88
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,587
Go, go, go!

89
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,840
Keep that aimed right at it.

90
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,184
Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.

91
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,894
Right at it.

92
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,438
Stay on it.

93
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,107
Here we go.

94
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,952
Nice one, Tom.

95
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,793
Dad?

96
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,963
I almost got it. Don't stop. Don't stop!

97
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,464
Dad!

98
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,007
Tom!

99
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,889
You told me to keep driving.

100
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:58,186
Well, I guess that answers the old
"if I asked you to drive off a cliff" scenario.

101
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,234
- We lost it.
- No, we didn't.

102
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,581
Want to give it a whirl?

103
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:25,964
This way.

104
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,429
Go.

105
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,433
Let's lay her down right there
at the edge of the reservoir.

106
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,439
Nicely done.

107
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,318
How long you think it's been up there?

108
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,030
Delhi Mission Control went down,
same as ours...

109
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,032
...ten years ago.

110
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,284
So for ten years?

111
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,873
- Why did it come down so low?
- I don't know.

112
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,959
Maybe the sun cooked its brain
or it was looking for something.

113
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,378
- What?
- Give me a large flatblade.

114
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,465
Maybe some kind of signal? I don't know.

115
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,221
What are you gonna do with it?

116
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,309
I'm gonna give it something
socially responsible to do...

117
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,519
...like drive a combine.

118
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,605
Can't we just let it go?

119
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,567
It wasn't hurting anybody.

120
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,738
This thing needs to learn
how to adapt, Murph...

121
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,531
...like the rest of us.

122
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,829
How's this work?
You guys come with?

123
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,039
I've got class.

124
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,833
This one needs to wait.

125
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,171
- What did you do?
- They'll tell you about it in there.

126
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,507
- Am I gonna be mad?
- Not with me.

127
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,843
- Just please try not to.
- Hey. Relax.

128
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,596
I got this.

129
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,143
Little late, Coop.

130
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,853
Yeah, we had a flat.

131
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,565
And I guess you had to stop off
at the Asian fighter plane store.

132
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,444
No, actually, sir,
that's a surveillance drone.

133
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,364
With outstanding solar cells. It's Indian.

134
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,116
Take a seat.

135
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,743
So...

136
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,038
...we got Tom's scores back.

137
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,541
He's going to make an excellent farmer.

138
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:28,211
Yeah, he's got a knack for it.
What about college?

139
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:32,132
The university only takes a handful.
They don't have the resources to...

140
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,592
I still pay my taxes.

141
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,761
Where's that money go?
There's no more armies.

142
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,597
Well, it doesn't go to the university.

143
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,808
Look, Coop, you have to be realistic.

144
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,769
You're ruling my son out for college now?

145
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,815
- The kid's 15.
- Tom's score simply isn't high enough.

146
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,985
What's your waistline? About what, 32?

147
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:56,072
- About a 33 inseam?
- I'm not sure I see what you're getting at.

148
00:10:56,239 --> 00:11:00,660
It takes two numbers to measure your ass
but only one to measure my son's future?

149
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,414
Come on. You're a well-educated man, Coop.

150
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,541
- And a trained pilot.
- And an engineer.

151
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:11,796
Okay, well, right now
we don't need more engineers.

152
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:16,593
We didn't run out of television screens
and planes. We ran out of food.

153
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,346
The world needs farmers.
Good farmers, like you.

154
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,891
- And Tom.
- Uneducated farmers.

155
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,729
We're a caretaker generation, Coop.
And things are getting better.

156
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,024
- Maybe your grandkids will get to be engin...
- Are we done here, sir?

157
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,401
No.

158
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,404
Miss Hanley's here to talk about Murph.

159
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,282
Murph is a great kid. She's really bright.

160
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,701
But she's been having
a little trouble lately.

161
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:45,246
She brought this in to show the students.
The section on the lunar landings.

162
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,916
Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.

163
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,376
She always loved the pictures.

164
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,255
It's an old federal textbook. We've
replaced them with the corrected versions.

165
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,465
Corrected?

166
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:59,761
Explaining how the Apollo missions were
faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

167
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,436
You don't believe we went to the moon?

168
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,564
It was a brilliant piece of propaganda.

169
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,567
The Soviets bankrupted themselves
pouring resources...

170
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,986
...into rockets and other useless machines.

171
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,238
"Useless machines."

172
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:22,492
If we don't want a repeat of the excess
and wastefulness of the 20th century, then...

173
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:26,454
...we need to teach our kids about this planet,
not tales of leaving it.

174
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:31,292
One of those useless machines
they used to make was called an MRI.

175
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:35,004
If we had any of those left,
the doctors would've been able to find...

176
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,925
...the cyst in my wife's brain
before she died instead of afterwards.

177
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,178
Then she'd have been the one
listening to this instead of me...

178
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,431
...which would have been a good thing,
because she was always...

179
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,517
...the calmer one.

180
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,270
I'm sorry about your wife, Mr. Cooper.

181
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:55,191
But Murph got into a fistfight
with several of her classmates over this...

182
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,026
...Apollo nonsense.

183
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,654
So we thought it best
to bring you in and see what ideas...

184
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,490
...you might have for dealing
with her behavior on the home front.

185
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,744
Yeah, you know what?
There's a game tomorrow night.

186
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,038
She's going through a bit
of a baseball phase.

187
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:13,418
Her favorite team is playing.
There's gonna be candy and soda and...

188
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,339
I think I'll take her to that.

189
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,929
How'd it go?

190
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,724
I got you suspended.

191
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,475
- What?
- Cooper.

192
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,395
This is Cooper. Go.

193
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,398
Coop, those combines you rebuilt
went haywire.

194
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,734
Just reset the controllers.

195
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,695
I did that.
Now you should come take a look.

196
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:03,426
One by one they've been
peeling off the fields and heading over.

197
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,428
Something's interfering with the compass.

198
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,307
Magnetism or some such.

199
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,893
Nothing special about which book.

200
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,813
I've been working on it, like you said.

201
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,066
- I counted the spaces.
- Why?

202
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,195
In case the ghost is trying to communicate.

203
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,531
I'm trying Morse.

204
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,366
Morse?

205
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,784
Yeah.

206
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,829
- Dots and dashes, used...
- I know what Morse code is, Murph.

207
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,915
I just don't think
your bookshelf's trying to talk to you.

208
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,889
Had to reset every compass clock and GPS
to offset for the anomaly.

209
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,725
- Which is?
- I don't know.

210
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,646
If the house was built on magnetic ore...

211
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,899
...we'd have seen this the first time
we switched on the tractor.

212
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,738
I hear your meeting at the school
didn't go so well.

213
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,074
You heard?

214
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,870
It's like we've forgotten
who we are, Donald.

215
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:59,041
Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.

216
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,378
When I was a kid...

217
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:06,674
...it felt like they made something new
every day. Some...

218
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,344
...gadget or idea.
Like every day was Christmas.

219
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,473
But six billion people...

220
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,892
...just try to imagine that.

221
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,896
And every last one of them
trying to have it all.

222
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,193
This world isn't so bad.

223
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,655
And Tom will do just fine.

224
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:34,202
You're the one who doesn't belong.
Born 40 years too late, or 40 years too early.

225
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:37,705
My daughter knew it, God bless her.

226
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,375
And your kids know it. Especially Murph.

227
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,129
Well, we used to look up in the sky
and wonder...

228
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,673
...at our place in the stars.

229
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:54,472
Now we just look down and worry
about our place in the dirt.

230
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,808
Cooper, you were good at something...

231
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,645
...and you never got a chance
to do anything with it.

232
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,772
I'm sorry.

233
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:05,900
You didn't expect...

234
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,611
...this dirt that was
giving you this food...

235
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,031
...to turn on you like that
and destroy you.

236
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,661
In April... I believe I'm right...
Fifteenth of April, I think.

237
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,413
This happened about 1:30 when that thing...

238
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,499
...came off the top of that canyon.

239
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,336
In my day, we had real ballplayers.

240
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,255
Who are these bums?

241
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,132
In my day, people were too busy...

242
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,343
...fighting over food
to even play baseball.

243
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:37,515
Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural.
I want a hot dog.

244
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,809
School says you're gonna follow
in my footsteps.

245
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,061
I think that's great.

246
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:45,648
- You think that's great?
- You hate farming, Dad.

247
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,067
Grandpa said.

248
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,652
Grandpa said?

249
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,613
Listen, all that matters
is how you feel about it.

250
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,448
I like what you do.

251
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,659
I like our farm.

252
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,953
You're gonna be great at it.

253
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,301
Let's get out of here.

254
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,560
All right, it's a doozy.

255
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,104
All right, gang, let's mask up.

256
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,443
- Tom? Murph? Check?
- Yeah.

257
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,582
Murph, Tom, you guys shut your windows?

258
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,088
Murph?

259
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:54,777
The ghost.

260
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,655
Grab your pillow.

261
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,282
You're sleeping in with Tom.

262
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,881
It's not a ghost.

263
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,721
It's gravity.

264
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,725
I'm dropping Tom, then heading to town.

265
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:12,188
You want to clean that up
when you've finished praying to it?

266
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,799
It's not Morse, Murph. It's binary.

267
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,259
Thick is one, thin is zero.

268
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,057
Coordinates.

269
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,145
Nope..

270
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,773
Here we go.

271
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,734
Thirty-three.

272
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,738
That's it.

273
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,699
I can't miss this!

274
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,203
Grandpa will be back
in a couple hours, Murph.

275
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,665
But you don't know what you're gonna find.

276
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,000
And that...

277
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,170
...is why I can't take you.

278
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,386
Murph?

279
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,975
Grandpa will be home in a while.
Tell him I'll call him on the radio.

280
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,399
Jesus.

281
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,318
What are you doing?

282
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,612
You think this is funny?

283
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,282
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.

284
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,119
Make yourself useful.

285
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:54,808
Hey, Murph?

286
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,478
Murph!

287
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,317
I think this is the end of the road.

288
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,364
Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?

289
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,783
That's my girl.

290
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,770
Step away!

291
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:43,023
Don't shoot! I'm not armed.
My daughter's in the car.

292
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,823
Don't be afraid.

293
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,629
How did you find this place?

294
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,673
Where's my daughter?

295
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:11,885
You had the coordinates for this facility
marked on your map. Where did you get them?

296
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,387
Where's my daughter?

297
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:16,473
Don't make me take you down again.
Sit down!

298
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:19,018
You still think you're a Marine, pal?

299
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,770
Marines don't exist anymore.

300
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:27,026
- And I got grunts like you mowing my grass.
- Where did you find those coordinates?

301
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,778
But you don't look much like a lawnmower.

302
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,781
Think I'll turn you
into an overqualified vacuum cleaner.

303
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,158
No, you won't.

304
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,703
TARS, back down, please.

305
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,332
You know, you're taking a risk
using ex-military security.

306
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,628
They're old, and their control units
are unpredictable.

307
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,797
It's what the government could spare.

308
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:51,633
Who are you?

309
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,427
Dr. Brand.

310
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,971
I knew a Dr. Brand once.
He was a professor.

311
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,848
What makes you think I'm not?

312
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,642
Wasn't near as cute, either.

313
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,479
Please, Dr. Brand.
I don't have any idea what this is.

314
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,815
Now I'm scared for my daughter
and want her by my side.

315
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,443
You give me that,
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

316
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,824
Get the principals and the girl
in the conference room, please.

317
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,535
Your daughter is fine.

318
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,037
Bright kid.

319
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,456
Must have a very smart mother.

320
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:25,042
It's pretty clear you
don't want any visitors.

321
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:29,171
So why don't you just let us back up from
your fence and we'll be on our way?

322
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:32,007
- It's not that simple.
- Well, sure, it is.

323
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:36,011
I don't know anything about you.
I don't know anything about this place.

324
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,055
Yes, you do.

325
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:44,853
Dad!

326
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:48,565
Hello, Cooper.

327
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,068
Professor Brand.

328
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,197
Explain to me how you found this facility.

329
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:58,659
Kind of an accident. We sort of stumbled
upon it. We were on a salvage run...

330
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:01,537
You're sitting in the best-kept secret
in the world.

331
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:05,207
Nobody stumbles in here.
Nobody stumbles out.

332
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,209
Cooper, please.

333
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,753
Cooperate with these people.

334
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,130
Look.

335
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,715
It's kind of hard to explain.

336
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:18,220
We learned these coordinates
from an anomaly.

337
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,305
What sort of anomaly?

338
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,767
I hesitate to term it supernatural,
but it definitely wasn't scientific.

339
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:27,855
You're going to have to be specific,
Mr. Cooper. Right now.

340
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,273
It was gravity.

341
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:37,156
What sort of gravitational anomaly?
Where was this?

342
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,617
Now, I'm real happy that you're excited
about gravity, bud...

343
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,996
...but you're not getting any answers
from us until I get assurances.

344
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,455
- Assurances?
- Yeah.

345
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,751
Like, that we're getting out of here.
And I don't mean in the trunk of some car.

346
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,423
Don't you know who we are, Coop?

347
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,841
No, professor, I don't.

348
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,010
You know my father, Professor Brand.

349
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,928
We're NASA.

350
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,932
- NASA?
- NASA.

351
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,059
The same NASA you flew for.

352
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,780
I heard they shut you down, sir...

353
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,241
...for refusing to drop bombs
from the stratosphere...

354
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,951
...onto starving people.

355
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,454
When they realized
that killing other people was...

356
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,457
...not a long-term solution,
then they needed us back.

357
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,626
- In secret.
- Why secret?

358
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:34,630
Because public opinion wouldn't
allow spending on space exploration.

359
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,382
Not while you're struggling
to put food on the table.

360
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,968
Blight.

361
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:44,264
Wheat seven years ago. Okra this year.

362
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,683
Now there's just corn.

363
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:48,977
And we're growing more than we ever have.

364
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:53,315
But like the potatoes in Ireland
and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...

365
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,401
...the corn will die.

366
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,195
Soon.

367
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:07,079
We'll find a way, professor.
We always have.

368
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:11,833
Driven by the unshakable faith
the Earth is ours.

369
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,211
Not just ours, no.

370
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,338
But it is our home.

371
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:21,009
Earth's atmosphere is 30 percent nitrogen.

372
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,886
We don't even breathe nitrogen.

373
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:28,392
Blight does. And as it thrives,
our air gets less and less oxygen.

374
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,020
The last people to starve
will be the first to suffocate.

375
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,356
And your daughter's generation...

376
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,277
...will be the last to survive on Earth.

377
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:42,030
Murph is tired. I was wondering
if she could take a nap in my office.

378
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,032
Yeah. Thank you.

379
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:47,869
Okay...

380
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,374
...now you need to tell me
what your plan is to save the world.

381
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,545
We're not meant to save the world.
We're meant to leave it.

382
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:03,427
Rangers.

383
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:08,682
The last components of our one versatile
ship in orbit, the Endurance.

384
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,600
Our final expedition.

385
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:14,354
You sent people out there
looking for a new home?

386
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,273
The Lazarus missions.

387
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,568
- That sounds cheerful.
- Lazarus came back from the dead.

388
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,903
Sure, but he had to die in the first place.

389
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,240
There's not a planet in our solar system
that could sustain life...

390
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,909
...and the nearest star's
over a thousand years away.

391
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,746
That doesn't even qualify as futile.

392
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:33,749
Where'd you send them?

393
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,584
Cooper...

394
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,545
...I can't tell you anymore
unless you agree...

395
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,547
...to pilot this craft.

396
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:44,009
- You're the best pilot we ever had.
- I barely left the stratosphere.

397
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,428
This team never left the simulator.

398
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:50,557
We need a pilot, and this is the mission
that you were trained for.

399
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,225
Without even knowing it?

400
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:57,522
An hour ago, you didn't even know I was alive.
You were going anyway.

401
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,399
We had no choice.

402
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,318
But something sent you here.

403
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,363
- They chose you.
- Who's "they"?

404
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,247
How long would I be gone?

405
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,751
Hard to know. Years?

406
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,087
I've got kids, professor.

407
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,631
Get out there and save them.

408
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,386
Who's "they"?

409
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:31,348
We started detecting gravitational
anomalies almost 50 years ago.

410
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:35,310
Mostly small distortions to our instruments
in the upper atmosphere.

411
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:38,605
In fact, I believe
you encountered one yourself.

412
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,274
Yeah, over the Straights.

413
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:45,320
My crash. Something tripped my fly-by-wire.

414
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:46,696
Exactly.

415
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:52,452
But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this:

416
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,621
Out near Saturn...

417
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,873
...a disturbance of space-time.

418
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,129
- Is that a wormhole?
- It appeared 48 years ago.

419
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,506
And it leads where?

420
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,675
Another galaxy.

421
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,679
A wormhole's not
a naturally occurring phenomenon.

422
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,264
Someone placed it there.

423
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,558
"They"?

424
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:19,146
And whoever they are,
they appear to be looking out for us.

425
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,190
That wormhole lets us
travel to other stars.

426
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,276
It came along right as we needed it.

427
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,362
They've put potentially habitable worlds
right within our reach.

428
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,448
Twelve, in fact, from our initial probes.

429
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,992
You sent probes into that?

430
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,162
We sent people into it. Ten years ago.

431
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,165
The Lazarus missions.

432
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,708
Twelve possible worlds...

433
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,210
...twelve Ranger launches carrying...

434
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,088
...the bravest humans ever to live...

435
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,883
...led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

436
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,386
Each person's landing pod
had enough life support for two years.

437
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,513
But they could use hibernation
to stretch that...

438
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,892
...making observations on organics
over a decade or more.

439
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:00,896
Their mission was to assess their world,
and if it showed potential...

440
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:05,650
...then they could send out a signal,
bed down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.

441
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,861
And what if the world didn't show promise?

442
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,905
Hence the bravery.

443
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,241
You don't have the resources
to visit all 12.

444
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,534
No.

445
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,205
Data transmission back through
the wormhole is rudimentary.

446
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:23,418
Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us
some clue as to which worlds have potential.

447
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,378
And one system shows promise.

448
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,256
One. That's a bit of a long shot, isn't it?

449
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,927
One system with three potential worlds?

450
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,929
No long shot.

451
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,224
Okay.

452
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,268
So if we find a home...

453
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:46,399
- ...then what?
- That's the long shot.

454
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,945
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

455
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,406
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?

456
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,046
This entire facility's a centrifuge.

457
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,882
Some kind of vehicle. A space station?

458
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,968
Both. Plan A.

459
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,220
How do you get it off the ground?

460
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:19,057
The first gravitational anomalies
changed everything.

461
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:23,728
Suddenly we knew
that harnessing gravity was real.

462
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:28,733
So I started working on a theory
and we started building this station.

463
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,194
But you haven't solved it yet.

464
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,822
That's why there's Plan B.

465
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:39,035
The problem is gravity. How to get a viable
amount of human life off the planet.

466
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,495
This is one way.

467
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,331
Plan B: a population bomb.

468
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:48,420
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

469
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,630
How would you raise them?

470
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,258
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.

471
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:57,304
After that, with surrogacy,
the growth becomes exponential.

472
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:01,308
Within 30 years,
we could have a colony of hundreds.

473
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,853
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

474
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,022
This takes care of that.

475
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,649
But what about the people here? You just...

476
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,359
...give up on them?

477
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,236
My kids?

478
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:17,115
That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.

479
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,245
- How far have you got?
- Almost there.

480
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,831
You're asking me to hang everything...

481
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,208
...on an almost.

482
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:30,045
I'm asking you to trust me.

483
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,799
Find us a new home.

484
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,552
And by the time you return...

485
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,805
...I will have solved
the problem of gravity.

486
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,350
I give you my word.

487
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,489
Go away!

488
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,209
Murph.

489
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,587
Go! if you're leaving, just go.

490
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:18,218
This world was never enough
for you, was it, Coop?

491
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:22,806
What, because heading out there
is what I feel like I was born to do?

492
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,600
And it excites me?

493
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,770
No, that does not make it wrong.

494
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,063
It might.

495
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,566
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

496
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,653
The why of the thing,
that's the foundation.

497
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,905
And the foundation's solid.

498
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:47,080
We farmers, we sit here every year
when the rains fail and we say:

499
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,623
"Next year."

500
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,961
Well, next year ain't gonna save us,
nor the one after that.

501
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:57,924
This world's a treasure, Donald,
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.

502
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,433
Mankind was born on Earth,
it was never meant to die here.

503
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,772
Tom will be all right, but you got
to make things right with Murph.

504
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:13,982
I will.

505
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:18,111
Without making promises
you don't know you can keep.

506
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,749
You have to talk to me, Murph.

507
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,378
I need to fix this before I go.

508
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,423
Then I'll keep it broken
so you have to stay.

509
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:45,013
After you kids came along, your mom said
something to me I never quite understood.

510
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,015
She said, "Now...

511
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:53,396
...we're just here
to be memories for our kids."

512
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,029
And I think that now I understand
what she meant.

513
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:08,536
Once you're a parent,
you're the ghost of your children's future.

514
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:12,332
You said ghosts didn't exist.

515
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,298
That's right, Murph.

516
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,844
Murph, look at me.

517
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,391
I can't be your ghost right now.

518
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,187
I need to exist.

519
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,732
They chose me.

520
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:42,403
Murph, they chose me. You saw.
You're the one who led me to them.

521
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,534
That's exactly why you can't go.

522
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,705
I figured out the message.

523
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:56,334
- One word. Know what it is?
- Murph.

524
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,836
"Stay."

525
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:01,089
- It says, "Stay," Dad.
- Murph.

526
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,508
You don't believe me.

527
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,469
Look at the books! Look at this.
It says, "Stay."

528
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,597
Why...? You're not listening!
It says, "Stay!"

529
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,766
No, I'm coming back.

530
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,268
When?

531
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,741
One for you, one for me.

532
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,287
When I'm up there in hypersleep, or...

533
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,164
...traveling near the speed of light, or...

534
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,293
...near a black hole...

535
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:43,298
...time's gonna change for me.
It's gonna run more slowly.

536
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,676
When we get back...

537
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,220
...we're gonna compare.

538
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,015
- Time will run differently for us?
- Yeah.

539
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:57,770
By the time I get back,
we might even be the same age, you and me.

540
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,481
"What?" Imagine that!

541
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,195
Aw, Murph...

542
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,990
You have no idea when you're coming back.

543
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,285
No idea at all!

544
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,540
Murph, don't... Don't
make me leave like this.

545
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,208
Come on, Murph!

546
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,045
Don't make me leave like this, Murph!

547
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,678
Hey...

548
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,555
...I love you.

549
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,849
Forever. You hear me?

550
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:38,519
I love you forever, and I'm coming back.

551
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,652
I'm coming back.

552
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,047
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

553
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,257
Just fine.

554
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:15,848
I love you, Tom.

555
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,518
- Travel safe?
- Yeah.

556
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,937
You look after our place for me, all right?

557
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:22,730
All right?

558
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:30,613
- Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?
- You mean your truck?

559
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,741
I'll make sure they bring it back.

560
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,662
Look after my kids, Donald!

561
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:53,761
Go for main engine start. T-minus 10...

562
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,514
- Dad!
- ...nine...

563
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:57,932
Dad!

564
00:41:58,558 --> 00:41:59,600
...eight...

565
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,020
...seven...

566
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,438
Dad!

567
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,814
...six...

568
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,110
...five, main engine start, four...

569
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:11,612
...three...

570
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,406
...two...

571
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,409
...one. Booster ignition and...

572
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,337
All engines look good.
Beginning roll program.

573
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,470
Prepare for stage one separation.

574
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:36,846
Stage one.

575
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,645
There is Mach 1.

576
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:49,317
Everybody good?
Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?

577
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:54,489
They gave him a humor setting
so he'd fit in better with his unit.

578
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,491
He thinks it relaxes us.

579
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:59,452
A giant sarcastic robot.

580
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:01,746
What a great idea!

581
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,624
I have a cue light I can use
when I'm joking if you like.

582
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:05,833
That'd probably help.

583
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,921
You can use it to find your way back
to the ship after I blow you out the airlock.

584
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,008
- What's your humor setting, TARS?
- That's 100 percent.

585
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,968
Let's bring it on down to 75, please.

586
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,137
Stage two separation.

587
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,983
All feeds going manual.

588
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,693
Going manual.

589
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,156
Deactivate probe heater one, two and three.

590
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,366
Check.

591
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,874
- Taking control.
- This is handover to you.

592
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,005
- A.D.F. check.
- Over.

593
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:57,009
Pull thrusters back.
Fuel cells one, two, three.

594
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,511
One hundred percent.

595
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,513
Ex-mites.

596
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,315
It's hard leaving everything.

597
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:14,193
My kids. Your father.

598
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,196
We're going to be spending
a lot of time together.

599
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:20,408
- We should learn to talk.
- And when not to.

600
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,245
Just being honest.

601
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:26,747
I don't think you need to be that honest.

602
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,584
Hey, TARS, what's your honesty parameter?

603
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,378
- Ninety percent.
- Ninety percent?

604
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:35,590
Absolute honesty isn't always
the most diplomatic, nor the...

605
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,342
...safest form of communication
with emotional beings.

606
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,969
Okay.

607
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:43,055
Ninety percent it is, Dr. Brand.

608
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,979
We are coming up on the Endurance.
Twelve minutes out.

609
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,081
Okay. Taking control.

610
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,421
Approaching module port, 500 meters.

611
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:29,560
It's all you, Doyle.

612
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,581
Nice and easy, Doyle. Nice and easy.

613
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,004
I feel good.

614
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,339
Take us home.

615
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,474
- Lock.
- Target locked.

616
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:10,476
- Well done.
- Okay, helmets on.

617
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:11,686
Good job.

618
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:46,887
Door's not charging.

619
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,556
Never mind.

620
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,039
Cooper, you should have control.

621
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,874
Control here.

622
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:18,919
Communication with ring module active.

623
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:33,893
That's initiate.

624
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:43,944
- Are we ready to spin?
- Just a sec.

625
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,708
- Hello, CASE.
- Hello, TARS.

626
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,586
All right, we're all set.

627
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:02,546
All right, let's do it.

628
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,993
Thirty percent of spin.

629
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,252
One G.

630
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,004
How's gravity treating you back there?

631
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,506
Well.

632
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:50,469
Romilly? Hey, you okay?

633
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:51,679
- Yeah.
- You all right?

634
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:53,931
Yeah, I just need a minute.

635
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:59,019
We have some Dramamine in the hab pod,
or maybe in the cryo-beds. I'll just be a sec.

636
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,355
- Hey, Brand?
- Yeah?

637
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,524
Bring a lot.

638
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:14,869
Amelia, be safe.

639
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,706
- Give my regards to Dr. Mann.
- I will, Dad.

640
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,791
It looks good for your trajectory.

641
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,295
We've calculated two years to Saturn.

642
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,547
That's a lot of Dramamine.

643
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:29,717
Look after my family,
will you, please, sir?

644
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:33,053
We'll be waiting for you when you get back.

645
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:37,391
A little older, a little wiser,
but happy to see you.

646
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,564
Do not go gentle into that good night

647
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:48,277
Old age should burn
and rave at close of day

648
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:54,408
Rage, rage against the dying of the light

649
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:59,079
Though wise men at their end
Know dark is right

650
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,291
Because their words had forked
No lightning they

651
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:06,253
Do not go gentle into that good night

652
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:11,258
Rage, rage against the dying of the light

653
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,527
- You good?
- Yeah.

654
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,946
Okay, thank you.

655
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,784
Here. Pills.

656
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:40,955
So alone.

657
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,415
We have each other. Dr. Mann had it worse.

658
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:44,959
No, I mean them.

659
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:49,713
It's a perfect planet,
and we won't find another one like her.

660
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:53,551
No, it's not like looking for a new condo.

661
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,845
The human race is going to be...

662
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:58,389
...adrift...

663
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:02,059
...desperate for a rock it can cling to
while it catches its breath.

664
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:04,478
We need to find that rock.

665
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:07,523
And our three prospects
are at the edge of what...

666
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,567
...might sustain human life.

667
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,528
Laura Miller's planet is first.

668
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:14,822
Laura started our biology program.

669
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:22,997
- Wolf Edmunds is here.
- Tell me about Edmunds.

670
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:26,584
Wolf's a particle physicist.

671
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:31,213
None of them had families?

672
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:35,134
No. No attachments. My father insisted.

673
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:38,846
They all knew the odds against
ever seeing another human being again.

674
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,973
I'm hoping we can surprise
at least three of them.

675
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,058
- How about Mann?
- Dr. Mann?

676
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,144
He's remarkable. He's the best of us.

677
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:49,690
He inspired 11 people to follow him
on the loneliest journey in human history.

678
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,442
Scientists, explorers.

679
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:55,696
That's what I love.
You know, out there we face great odds.

680
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,615
Death, but...

681
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,701
...not evil.

682
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:02,745
You don't think nature can be evil?

683
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,789
No. Formidable. Frightening. But...

684
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:08,584
...no, not evil.

685
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:13,047
Is a lion evil
because it rips a gazelle to shreds?

686
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,549
Just what we take with us, then.

687
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,134
Yeah.

688
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,637
This crew represents the best of humanity.

689
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:20,971
Even me?

690
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,140
You know what? We agreed, 90 percent.

691
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:24,391
There you go.

692
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,186
- Don't stay up.
- I'll be there in a minute.

693
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:31,398
Just remember, Coop,
you are literally wasting your breath.

694
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:41,241
Hey, TARS?
Let's go over that trajectory one more time.

695
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,243
Eight months to Mars.

696
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:46,580
Counter-orbital slingshot around.
Fourteen months to Saturn.

697
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:48,165
Nothing's changed on that.

698
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:50,417
Just let me ask you something.

699
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:56,131
- Dr. Brand and Edmunds...
- Why are you whispering? They can't hear you.

700
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,594
Dr. Brand and Edmunds. They close?

701
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:02,179
I wouldn't know.

702
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:05,349
Is that 90 percent "wouldn't know"
or 10 percent "wouldn't know"?

703
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:08,644
I also have a discretion setting, Cooper.

704
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:12,272
But not a poker face, Slick.

705
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:25,869
Hey, guys.

706
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:29,373
Dad's about to go down for the long nap.

707
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:32,334
So I wanted to give you an update.

708
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:37,881
The Earth looks amazing from here.

709
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:41,260
You can't see any of the dust.

710
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:45,556
I really hope you guys are doing great.

711
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:50,144
I know you'll get this message.
Professor Brand's assured me he'll get it to you.

712
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:52,730
Know that I love you.

713
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,483
- Is it him?
- I don't think so, Murph.

714
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,033
You must be Donald.

715
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,412
Hello, Murph.

716
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:11,165
Why are you in my dad's truck?

717
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,959
He wanted me to bring it for your brother.

718
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,879
He sent you a message.

719
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,967
She's pretty upset with him for leaving.

720
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:26,221
If you record any messages,
I can get them to transmit it to Cooper.

721
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:29,975
Murph is a bright spark.

722
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,520
Maybe I should fan the flame.

723
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,273
She's already making fools of her teachers.

724
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,276
So maybe she should come
and make a fool out of you.

725
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,197
- So where are they?
- Heading for Mars.

726
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:47,910
The next time you hear from Cooper,
they'll be coming up on Saturn.

727
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,576
As far as school goes...

728
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:32,913
...the administration wants me
to repeat Plant Pathology. Which sucks.

729
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:36,625
But they said I could start
Advanced Agriculture a year early.

730
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:42,297
All right, I got to go, Dad.
Hope you're safe up there.

731
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,928
Sorry, Coop.

732
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:52,933
I asked Murph to say hi,
but she's as stubborn as her old man.

733
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,185
I'll try again next time.

734
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,785
You all right, Rom?

735
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,956
This gets to me, Cooper.

736
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:17,791
This. This.

737
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:21,169
Millimeters of aluminum, that's it,
and then nothing...

738
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:25,299
...out there for millions of miles
won't kill us in seconds.

739
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,135
You know that some of the finest...

740
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:32,139
...solo yachtsmen in the world
don't know how to swim?

741
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:35,893
They don't know how.
And if they go overboard, they're done.

742
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,605
We're explorers, Rom.

743
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:42,858
This is our boat.

744
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:44,151
Here.

745
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,013
This is from the relay probe?

746
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,223
It was in orbit around the wormhole.

747
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:18,769
This is the wormhole,
and every time we'd come around...

748
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:22,147
...we would receive images
from the other side of the foreign galaxy.

749
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,608
Yeah. Like swinging a periscope around.

750
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:25,859
Exactly.

751
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:30,530
So we got a pretty good idea what we're
gonna find on the other side?

752
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:32,950
Navigationally.

753
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:38,163
Guys? We'll be approaching
the wormhole in about three hours.

754
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:45,587
Hey, Coop?

755
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,215
Can we stop the spinning?

756
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:49,466
Why?

757
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:51,969
Because we're close enough to see it now?

758
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:54,930
All right.

759
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:56,181
Thanks.

760
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:03,897
There, that's it! That's the wormhole!

761
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:05,857
Say it, don't spray it, Rom.

762
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:07,526
It's a sphere.

763
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:11,655
Of course it is. What, you...?
You thought it would just be a hole?

764
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:15,951
No, it's just that all the illustrations
I've ever seen, they...

765
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,579
In the illustrations,
they're trying to show you how it works.

766
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:24,126
So they say you want to go
from here to there.

767
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:27,004
But it's too far, right?

768
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:31,967
So a wormhole bends space like this,
so you can take a shortcut through...

769
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,885
...a higher dimension.

770
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,512
Okay, so...

771
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:39,766
...to show that, they've turned
three-dimensional space into two dimensions...

772
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:43,895
...which turns a wormhole
into two dimensions, a circle.

773
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:46,314
What's a circle in three dimensions?

774
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,026
- A sphere.
- Exactly.

775
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:50,944
A spherical hole.

776
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:54,322
But who put it there?
Who do we have to thank?

777
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:59,411
I'm not thanking anybody
until we get out of here in one piece, Rom.

778
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,045
Any trick to this, Doyle?

779
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,048
No one knows.

780
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,848
The others made it, right?

781
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,560
At least some of them.

782
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:58,678
Everybody ready to say goodbye
to our solar system?

783
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,556
To our galaxy.

784
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:04,518
Here we go.

785
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:40,637
The controls won't work here.
We're passing through the bulk.

786
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:45,225
It's space beyond our three dimensions.
All you can do is record and observe.

787
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:57,445
What is that?

788
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:01,658
I think it's them.

789
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:03,827
Distorting space-time.

790
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:06,997
Don't! Don't!

791
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:36,276
What was that?

792
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:40,780
The first handshake.

793
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:43,491
We're...

794
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,453
We're here.

795
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,059
So the lost communications came through.

796
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:12,103
- How?
- The relay on this side cached them.

797
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:15,815
So years of basic data. No real surprises.

798
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:20,570
Miller's site has kept pinging thumbs up,
as has Dr. Mann's.

799
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,864
Edmunds' went down three years ago.

800
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:24,241
Transmitter failure?

801
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:27,410
Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up
right until it went dark.

802
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,329
But Miller's still looks
good though, right?

803
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:31,790
Because she's coming up fast.

804
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:34,251
With one complication.

805
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:37,671
The planet is much closer to Gargantua
than we thought.

806
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:40,507
- Gargantua?
- It's what we're calling the black hole.

807
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:42,968
Miller's and Dr. Mann's
planets both orbit it.

808
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:46,346
- And Miller's is on the horizon?
- As a basketball around a hoop.

809
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:48,515
Landing there takes us dangerously close.

810
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:51,935
And a black hole that big
has a huge gravitational pull.

811
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:57,524
Look, I could swing around that
neutron star to decelerate.

812
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:59,567
No, it's not that. It's time.

813
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:04,239
The gravity on that planet will slow our
clock compared to Earth's drastically.

814
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:06,032
How bad?

815
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:09,744
Every hour we spend on
that planet will be...

816
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,789
...seven years back on Earth.

817
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:14,708
Jesus.

818
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,710
Well, that's relativity, folks.

819
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:20,588
Well, we can't just drop down
there without...

820
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,632
Cooper, we have a mission.

821
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,385
Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission,
and our mission Plan A is...

822
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:28,722
...to find a planet that can habitate
the people that are living on Earth now.

823
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:31,725
You can't just think about your family.
Now you have to think bigger.

824
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:35,103
I am thinking about my family
and millions of other families, okay?

825
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:39,524
Plan A does not work if the people on Earth
are dead by the time we pull it off.

826
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,485
No. It doesn't.

827
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,487
That's why there's a Plan B.

828
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:47,907
Okay. Cooper's right.

829
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:51,911
We need to think of time as a resource,
like oxygen and food. Going down will cost us.

830
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:55,457
All right, look.

831
01:03:56,750 --> 01:04:00,211
Dr. Mann's data is promising,
but it will take months to get there.

832
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:02,589
And Edmunds', it's even further.

833
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:06,926
Miller hasn't sent much, but what she has
is very promising. It's water, it's organics...

834
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,262
- You don't find that every day.
- No, you don't.

835
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:11,765
And just think about the resources,
including time...

836
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:14,434
...that would be spent
trying to get back here.

837
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,354
- Romilly...
- Yeah?

838
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:21,358
...how far off from Miller's planet
do we have to be to stay out of the time shift?

839
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,193
Just back from the cusp.

840
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,321
All right, which is here,
just outside of Miller's planet.

841
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:28,281
- Right.
- Okay.

842
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,993
Here's Gargantua. Here's Miller's planet.

843
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,330
Instead of taking the Endurance into orbit
around Miller's planet...

844
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:38,375
...which would conserve fuel,
but we would lose a lot of time...

845
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:42,629
...what if we take a wider orbit around
Gargantua, parallel with Miller's planet...

846
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:45,298
...outside of this time shift, to here?

847
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:48,259
Then we take the Ranger down,
we get Miller, we get her samples.

848
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:51,137
We come back, we analyze, we debrief.
We're in, we're out.

849
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:53,640
We lose a little fuel,
but we save a whole lot of time.

850
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:55,642
- That'll work.
- That's good.

851
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:58,269
There's no time for monkey business
or chit-chat down there.

852
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:01,231
So, TARS, you should definitely stay here.

853
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:03,650
CASE, you're with me. Anyone else can stay.

854
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:07,404
If we're talking about a couple years,
I could use the time to research gravity.

855
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,532
Observations from the wormhole,
that's gold to Professor Brand.

856
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:12,367
TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua.

857
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:17,288
Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting,
but make sure we stay in range of Miller's planet.

858
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,999
- You got it?
- I wouldn't leave you behind...

859
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,209
...Dr. Brand.

860
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,507
- You ready, CASE?
- Yup.

861
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:31,970
- You don't say much, do you?
- TARS talks plenty for both of us.

862
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:34,222
Detach.

863
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:44,482
- Romilly, are you reading these forces?
- It's unbelievable.

864
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:49,821
A literal heart of darkness.

865
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:56,703
If we could just see
the collapsed star inside...

866
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:59,622
...the singularity, yeah,
we'd solve gravity.

867
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:03,334
- And we can't get anything from it?
- Nothing escapes that horizon.

868
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:04,836
Not even light.

869
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:08,506
- The answer's there, just no way to see it.
- There's Miller's planet.

870
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:12,510
Goodbye, Ranger.

871
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:27,609
This is fast for atmospheric entry.

872
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:30,028
- Should we use the thrusters to slow?
- No.

873
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:33,823
I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics
to save some fuel.

874
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,200
Air brake?

875
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:38,912
- We want to get down fast, don't we?
- We want to get there in one piece.

876
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:42,081
- Hang on.
- Brand, Doyle, get ready.

877
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:00,433
- We should ease!
- Hands where I can see them.

878
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,937
The only time I went down was when a
machine was easing at the wrong time.

879
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:06,940
- A little caution...
- Can get you killed, like reckless driving.

880
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,275
- Cooper, it's too damn fast!
- I got this.

881
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:18,117
- Should I disable the feedback?
- No. I need to feel the air.

882
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:23,289
Here we go.

883
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:27,877
It's just water!

884
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:30,880
The stuff of life.

885
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:32,757
Twelve hundred meters.

886
01:07:32,924 --> 01:07:34,968
- Do we have a fix on the beacon?
- Got it!

887
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,762
- Can you maneuver?
- I'll need to shave some speed.

888
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:40,557
I'm gonna spiral down on top of it.
Everybody hang on!

889
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:44,018
Seven hundred.

890
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:48,147
On my cue, CASE. On my cue.

891
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:53,152
Five hundred meters.

892
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:03,663
Fire!

893
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:18,303
Very graceful.

894
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:19,554
No.

895
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:22,265
But very efficient.

896
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:26,936
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

897
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,022
Go, go, go!

898
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,692
Seven years per hour here.
Let's make it count!

899
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:00,053
This way.

900
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:04,641
About 200 meters.

901
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,777
The gravity's punishing.

902
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:18,863
Been floating through space too long?

903
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:21,074
One hundred and thirty percent
Earth gravity.

904
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,409
Come on. Come on.

905
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:28,873
- There's nothing here.
- Should be right here.

906
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:33,795
If the signal's coming from here, then...

907
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:44,597
Her beacon.

908
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:53,773
Wreckage.

909
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,608
Where's the rest?

910
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:57,610
Towards the mountains!

911
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,282
Those aren't mountains.

912
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,285
They're waves.

913
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:14,293
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

914
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:16,796
That one's moving away from us.

915
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:24,971
We need the recorder.

916
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:37,400
Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!

917
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,945
We're not leaving without her data.

918
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:42,447
Get back here now!

919
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:44,323
We do not have time!

920
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,951
The second wave is coming!
We're in the middle of a swell.

921
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,662
No, I got it.

922
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:51,831
Get your ass back to the Ranger now!

923
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:58,880
Brand, get back here now!

924
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,050
No, Cooper, go.
Cooper, go. I can't make it.

925
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:05,845
- Go!
- CASE, go get her.

926
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:12,643
- Go!
- Get up. Get up, Brand!

927
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:15,062
Go, go! Go!

928
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:19,484
- I'm not gonna make it!
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are!

929
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:28,618
Come on, CASE has her!
Get back here, Doyle!

930
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:32,705
Come on!

931
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:36,876
Get to the hatch!

932
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:42,924
Go, go! Go!

933
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:49,555
Shit.

934
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:51,891
Manually overriding inside hatch!

935
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:56,562
Cooper! Wait!

936
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:07,573
The engines are flooded!
I'm gonna have to shut her down.

937
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,358
Holy shit.

938
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:48,114
Hang on!

939
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:20,605
CASE, what's the problem?

940
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:23,190
Too waterlogged. Let it drain.

941
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:25,526
Goddamn it!

942
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:30,364
- I told you to leave me! Why didn't you?
- And I told you to get your ass back here!

943
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:35,202
- One of us was thinking about the mission!
- You were thinking about getting home.

944
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:39,373
I was trying to do the right thing!

945
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,500
Can you tell that to Doyle?

946
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:45,963
- CASE, how much time?
- Forty-five to an hour.

947
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:49,091
The stuff of life?

948
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:52,178
What's this gonna cost us, Brand?

949
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:54,305
A lot. Decades.

950
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,855
What happened to Miller?

951
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:06,359
Judging by the wreckage, she was...

952
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:09,153
...broken up by a wave soon after impact.

953
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,156
How's the wreckage stayed together
after all these years?

954
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,409
Because of the time slippage.

955
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:21,040
On this planet's time,
she just landed hours ago.

956
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:24,335
She probably just died minutes ago.

957
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:28,547
The data Doyle received was just the
initial status echoing endlessly.

958
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:31,092
We are not prepared for this.

959
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,931
You eggheads have the survival skills
of a Boy Scout troop.

960
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:40,351
Well, we got this far on our brains.
Farther than any human in history.

961
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:42,103
Well, not far enough!

962
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:45,940
And now we're stuck here till there
won't be anyone left on Earth to save.

963
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:51,654
I'm counting every minute,
same as you, Cooper.

964
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,285
Is there any possibility...

965
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:02,081
...some kind of a way
we can maybe all jump in a black hole?

966
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:03,916
Gain back the years?

967
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:06,085
Don't shake your head at me.

968
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,254
Time is relative, okay?

969
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:11,465
It can stretch and it can squeeze, but...

970
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:14,176
...it can't run backwards. It just can't.

971
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:18,764
The only thing that can move across
dimensions, like time, is gravity.

972
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:22,643
Okay.

973
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:28,482
The beings that led us here,
they communicate...

974
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:30,484
- ...through gravity, right?
- Yes.

975
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:32,820
Could they be talking
to us from the future?

976
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:35,990
- Maybe.
- Okay. if they can...

977
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:40,453
"They" are beings of five dimensions.

978
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:44,206
To them, time might be
another physical dimension.

979
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,875
To them...

980
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:50,463
...the past might be a canyon
that they can climb into and the future...

981
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:53,632
...a mountain they can climb up.
But to us, it's not, okay?

982
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:57,136
Look, Cooper, I screwed up. I'm sorry.

983
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:01,057
But you knew about relativity.

984
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:05,436
Brand...

985
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:12,234
...my daughter was 10 years old.

986
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,654
I couldn't teach her
Einstein's theories before I left.

987
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:18,908
Couldn't you have told her
you were going to save the world?

988
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:20,534
No.

989
01:16:22,203 --> 01:16:26,373
When you become a parent,
one thing becomes really clear.

990
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:31,045
And that is that you want to make sure
your children feel safe.

991
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:35,841
And it rules out telling a 10-year-old
that the world is ending.

992
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:39,678
Cooper?

993
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:45,893
- How long for the engines, CASE?
- A minute or two.

994
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,145
We don't have it. Helmets on!

995
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:53,859
Brand, co-pilot, you're up.

996
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:56,529
CASE, blow the cabin oxygen
through the main thrusters!

997
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:58,405
- We're gonna spark it.
- Roger that.

998
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:00,032
- Locked.
- Depressurizing.

999
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:07,164
Engines up!

1000
01:17:36,026 --> 01:17:37,528
Hello, Rom.

1001
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:39,655
I've waited years.

1002
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:42,575
How...? How many years?

1003
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:47,371
- By now it must be...
- Twenty-three years...

1004
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:49,248
...four months, eight days.

1005
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:54,837
Doyle?

1006
01:18:01,051 --> 01:18:04,054
I thought I was prepared.
I knew the theory.

1007
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:06,932
Reality's different.

1008
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:09,143
And Miller?

1009
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:12,730
There's nothing here for us.

1010
01:18:15,482 --> 01:18:16,984
Why didn't you sleep?

1011
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:22,031
I had a couple of stretches. But I
stopped believing you were coming back.

1012
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:25,534
And something seemed wrong
about dreaming my life away.

1013
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:29,205
I learned what I could
from the black hole...

1014
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:32,041
...but I couldn't send
anything to your father.

1015
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:34,460
We've been receiving, but nothing gets out.

1016
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:36,712
- Is he alive?
- Yeah.

1017
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:38,923
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1018
01:18:41,926 --> 01:18:44,929
We've got years of messages stored.

1019
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:46,388
Cooper.

1020
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:49,558
Messages span 23 years.

1021
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:53,270
Play it from the beginning.

1022
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:58,025
Hey, Dad.

1023
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:01,278
Checking in. Saying hi.

1024
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:05,824
Finished second in school.

1025
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:09,828
Miss Kurling's still giving me C's though.

1026
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,957
Pulled me down, but second's not bad.

1027
01:19:14,124 --> 01:19:16,293
Grandpa attended the ceremony.

1028
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:22,841
I met another girl, Dad.

1029
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:24,593
I...

1030
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:27,346
I really think this is the one.

1031
01:19:28,639 --> 01:19:31,225
Name's Lois. That's her right there.

1032
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,272
Murphy stole Grandpa's car.

1033
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:39,608
She crashed it. She's okay, though.

1034
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:41,360
Hey, Dad.

1035
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:43,612
Look at this!

1036
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:45,948
You're a grandpa.

1037
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:49,034
His name's Jesse.

1038
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:54,290
I kind of wanted to call him Coop,
but Lois says maybe next time.

1039
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:59,378
Donald says he's already earned
the "great" part, so we just leave it at that.

1040
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:04,341
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

1041
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:06,760
Say "Bye-bye, Grandpa."

1042
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:08,971
Bye-bye, Grandpa. Okay.

1043
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:11,890
Sorry it's been a while.

1044
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:14,310
Just...

1045
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,522
...what with Jesse and all.

1046
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:27,364
Grandpa died last week.

1047
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:30,868
We buried him out in the back forty
next to Mom and...

1048
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,828
...Jesse.

1049
01:20:33,704 --> 01:20:36,790
Which is where we would have buried you
if you'd ever...

1050
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:39,043
...come back.

1051
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:42,796
Murph was there at the funeral.

1052
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:46,175
We don't see her that much,
but she came for that.

1053
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:51,805
You aren't listening to this, I know that.

1054
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:57,686
All these messages are just, like...

1055
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:02,524
...drifting out there in the darkness.

1056
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:05,944
Lois says that...

1057
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:09,490
...I have to let you go.

1058
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,700
And...

1059
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:13,285
...so...

1060
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:19,625
...I guess I'm letting you go.

1061
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:23,253
I don't know where you are, Dad...

1062
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:26,507
...but I hope that you're at peace.

1063
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,385
Goodbye.

1064
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:44,233
Hey, Dad.

1065
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:48,237
Hey, Murph.

1066
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:50,322
You son of a bitch.

1067
01:21:54,034 --> 01:21:56,537
I never made one of these
when you were still responding...

1068
01:21:56,703 --> 01:21:59,039
...because I was so mad at you for leaving.

1069
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:04,169
And then when you went quiet, it...

1070
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:09,633
...seemed like I should live with that decision.
And I have.

1071
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:16,557
But today's my birthday.

1072
01:22:20,227 --> 01:22:23,397
And it's a special one,
because you told me...

1073
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:31,864
You once told me that when you came back,
we might be the same age.

1074
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:36,660
And today I'm the age you were
when you left.

1075
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:41,748
So it would be a real good time
for you to come back.

1076
01:22:56,221 --> 01:23:00,517
I didn't mean to intrude. It's just that
I've never seen you in here before.

1077
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:03,312
I've never been in here before.

1078
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:08,192
I talk to Amelia all the time.

1079
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:10,027
It helps.

1080
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:13,447
- I'm glad you've started.
- I haven't. I...

1081
01:23:13,614 --> 01:23:16,116
I just had something I needed to get out.

1082
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:18,869
- I know they're still out there.
- I know.

1083
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:23,248
There are so many reasons their
communications might not be getting through.

1084
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:24,833
I know, professor.

1085
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:28,378
I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of.

1086
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:31,882
Them never coming back or...

1087
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:36,303
...coming back to find we've failed.

1088
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:37,888
Then let's succeed.

1089
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:39,973
So...

1090
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:44,686
...back to the fourth iteration.
Let's run it through some new fields.

1091
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:48,190
With respect, professor,
we've tried that hundreds of times.

1092
01:23:48,524 --> 01:23:52,194
It only has to work once, Murph.

1093
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:59,368
Every rivet that they strike
could have been a bullet.

1094
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:01,537
We've done well for the world here...

1095
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:06,458
...whether or not we crack the equation
before I kick the bucket.

1096
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:09,503
- Don't be morbid, professor.
- I'm not afraid of death.

1097
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:12,089
I'm an old physicist.

1098
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:15,008
I'm afraid of time.

1099
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:23,350
Time.

1100
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:27,062
You're afraid of time.

1101
01:24:29,648 --> 01:24:31,650
We've been trying to solve the equation...

1102
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:34,319
...without changing
the underlying assumption about time.

1103
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:36,196
- And?
- And that means...

1104
01:24:36,363 --> 01:24:40,826
...each iteration is an attempt
to prove its own proof.

1105
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:43,120
It's recursive. It's nonsensical.

1106
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:45,330
Are you calling my life's work...

1107
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:47,207
...nonsense, Murph?

1108
01:24:47,374 --> 01:24:49,418
No, I'm saying that
you've been trying to...

1109
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:53,380
...finish it with one arm... No, with both arms.
...tied behind your back.

1110
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:57,467
And I don't understand why.

1111
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:00,262
I'm an old man, Murph.

1112
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:03,807
Can we take this point up at another time?

1113
01:25:03,974 --> 01:25:06,101
I want to talk to my daughter.

1114
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:10,731
Stepping out into the universe...

1115
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:14,693
...we must confront the reality
of interstellar travel.

1116
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:20,157
We must reach far beyond
our own lifespans.

1117
01:25:20,324 --> 01:25:25,454
We must think not as individuals
but as a species.

1118
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:30,917
Do not go gentle into that good night

1119
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:35,672
TARS kept the Endurance
right where we needed her.

1120
01:25:35,839 --> 01:25:38,634
But the trip took years longer
than we anticipated.

1121
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:42,471
We no longer have the fuel
to visit both prospects, so...

1122
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:44,306
...we have to choose.

1123
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:46,642
But how?

1124
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:49,353
They're both promising.

1125
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:55,400
Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mann
is the one still transmitting, so...

1126
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:58,487
We've no reason to suspect
Edmunds's data would have soured.

1127
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:01,907
His world has key elements
to sustain human life.

1128
01:26:02,074 --> 01:26:05,243
- As does Dr. Mann's.
- Cooper, this is my field.

1129
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:07,454
And...

1130
01:26:08,246 --> 01:26:10,415
...I really believe Edmunds'
is the better prospect.

1131
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:13,919
- Why?
- Gargantua, that's why.

1132
01:26:15,045 --> 01:26:19,091
Look at Miller's planet.
Hydrocarbons, organics, yes...

1133
01:26:19,257 --> 01:26:23,679
...but no life. Sterile.
We'll find the same thing on Mann's.

1134
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:25,764
Because of the black hole?

1135
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:29,101
Murphy's Law.
Whatever can happen will happen.

1136
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:31,603
Accident is the first building block
of evolution.

1137
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:34,606
But when you're orbiting a black hole
not enough can happen.

1138
01:26:34,773 --> 01:26:39,069
It sucks in asteroids and comets,
other events which would otherwise reach you.

1139
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:41,279
We need to go further afield.

1140
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:44,241
You once said that Dr. Mann...

1141
01:26:45,492 --> 01:26:46,993
...was the best of us.

1142
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:50,455
He's remarkable.
We're only here because of him.

1143
01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:52,833
And yet... Yet here he is.

1144
01:26:52,999 --> 01:26:57,963
He's on the ground, and he's sending
a very unambiguous message, telling us...

1145
01:26:58,130 --> 01:26:59,840
...to come to his planet.

1146
01:27:00,006 --> 01:27:04,636
Granted, but Edmunds' data
is more promising.

1147
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:06,138
We should vote.

1148
01:27:06,304 --> 01:27:08,473
Well, if we vote,
there's something you should know.

1149
01:27:09,599 --> 01:27:10,642
Brand?

1150
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:12,477
He has a right to know.

1151
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:14,730
That has nothing to do with it.

1152
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:17,941
- What does?
- She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.

1153
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:20,652
- Is that true?
- Yes.

1154
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:26,533
And that makes me want to follow my heart.

1155
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:33,665
But maybe we've spent too long
trying to figure all this out with theory.

1156
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:35,250
You're a scientist, Brand.

1157
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:36,960
So listen to me...

1158
01:27:37,794 --> 01:27:42,507
...when I say that love
isn't something we invented. It's...

1159
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:45,844
...observable, powerful.

1160
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:49,639
It has to mean something.

1161
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:54,186
Love has meaning, yes.
Social utility, social bonding, child rearing...

1162
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:57,856
We love people who have died.
Where's the social utility in that?

1163
01:27:58,398 --> 01:27:59,441
None.

1164
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:03,487
Maybe it means something more,
something we can't...

1165
01:28:03,653 --> 01:28:05,697
...yet understand.

1166
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:09,326
Maybe it's some evidence, some...

1167
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:14,748
...artifact of a higher dimension
that we can't consciously perceive.

1168
01:28:14,915 --> 01:28:19,711
I'm drawn across the universe
to someone I haven't seen in a decade...

1169
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:22,714
...who I know is probably dead.

1170
01:28:23,048 --> 01:28:26,384
Love is the one thing
we're capable of perceiving...

1171
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:29,387
...that transcends dimensions
of time and space.

1172
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:35,560
Maybe we should trust that,
even if we can't understand it yet.

1173
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:42,234
All right, Cooper...

1174
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:45,403
...yes...

1175
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:49,908
...the tiniest possibility
of seeing Wolf again excites me.

1176
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:52,410
That doesn't mean I'm wrong.

1177
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:55,288
Honestly, Amelia...

1178
01:28:57,082 --> 01:28:58,250
...it might.

1179
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:07,759
TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's.

1180
01:29:24,651 --> 01:29:26,111
We'll lose about a third again.

1181
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:27,821
But next year...

1182
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:32,951
Next year I'm gonna work Nelson's farm
and we'll make it up.

1183
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:35,620
What happened to Nelson?

1184
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:43,753
Murph, would you like some more soufflé?

1185
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,299
Oh, no. I'm full, thanks. It was delicious.

1186
01:29:48,174 --> 01:29:50,176
Coop, finish your fritter, please.

1187
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:56,057
Will you spend the night?
Your room is exactly as you left it. It's ready.

1188
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:57,601
I need to get back.

1189
01:29:57,767 --> 01:30:00,312
My sewing machine is in there,
but there's plenty...

1190
01:30:00,478 --> 01:30:01,771
I need to...

1191
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:06,192
Too many memories.

1192
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:09,613
We might have something for that.
Hey, Coop.

1193
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:18,455
The dust.

1194
01:30:20,957 --> 01:30:23,335
Lois, I have a friend who...

1195
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:25,337
...could look at his lungs.

1196
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:46,191
- Amelia, I'm sorry.
- You were just being objective.

1197
01:30:46,358 --> 01:30:49,819
Unless you're punishing me
for screwing up on Miller's planet.

1198
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:52,238
No, this wasn't a personal decision.

1199
01:30:53,073 --> 01:30:57,118
If you're wrong, you will have
a very personal decision to make.

1200
01:30:57,285 --> 01:31:00,246
Your fuel calculations
are based on a return journey.

1201
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:04,459
Strike out on Mann's planet, and we'll have
to decide whether to return home...

1202
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:06,878
...or push on to Edmunds' with Plan B.

1203
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:10,882
Starting a colony could save us
from extinction.

1204
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:14,386
You might have to decide
between seeing your children again...

1205
01:31:14,552 --> 01:31:16,388
...and the future of the human race.

1206
01:31:17,889 --> 01:31:19,599
I trust you'll be as objective then.

1207
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:28,400
He's been asking for you since he came to.

1208
01:31:28,566 --> 01:31:30,193
We were trying to reach you.

1209
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:37,200
Murph.

1210
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:39,703
I'm here, professor.

1211
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:42,747
I let you all down.

1212
01:31:43,081 --> 01:31:46,418
No, you got us so far. Real close.

1213
01:31:48,253 --> 01:31:50,046
I'll finish what you started.

1214
01:31:50,213 --> 01:31:52,424
Good, good Murph.

1215
01:31:54,718 --> 01:31:57,012
You had faith...

1216
01:31:58,221 --> 01:31:59,514
...all those...

1217
01:32:00,473 --> 01:32:02,267
...all those years.

1218
01:32:03,935 --> 01:32:05,186
I...

1219
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:07,856
I asked you to have faith.

1220
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:12,402
I wanted you to believe...

1221
01:32:13,903 --> 01:32:15,780
...that your father...

1222
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:20,618
...would come back.

1223
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:22,078
I do, professor.

1224
01:32:23,705 --> 01:32:25,206
Forgive me, Murph.

1225
01:32:25,957 --> 01:32:27,959
There's nothing to forgive.

1226
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:31,671
I...

1227
01:32:32,255 --> 01:32:34,090
I lied, Murph.

1228
01:32:36,468 --> 01:32:38,261
I lied to you.

1229
01:32:44,601 --> 01:32:47,812
There was no need for him to...

1230
01:32:49,022 --> 01:32:50,899
To come back.

1231
01:32:53,485 --> 01:32:56,821
There is no way to help us.

1232
01:32:58,114 --> 01:32:59,157
But Plan A...

1233
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:02,827
All this. All these people.

1234
01:33:03,953 --> 01:33:05,747
And the equation.

1235
01:33:09,751 --> 01:33:11,503
Did my father know?

1236
01:33:15,298 --> 01:33:17,008
Did he leave me?

1237
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:22,013
Do...

1238
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:24,516
...not...

1239
01:33:25,475 --> 01:33:26,726
...go...

1240
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:29,521
...gentle...

1241
01:33:31,523 --> 01:33:32,690
No.

1242
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:35,443
No!

1243
01:33:36,653 --> 01:33:38,321
You can't leave.

1244
01:33:38,696 --> 01:33:39,948
You... No.

1245
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:45,703
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today. He had no pain.

1246
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:47,956
He was at peace.

1247
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:50,708
I'm very sorry for your loss.

1248
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:04,973
Brand, did you know?

1249
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:09,060
He told you, right?

1250
01:34:11,938 --> 01:34:13,314
You knew.

1251
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:17,026
This was all a sham.

1252
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:23,491
You left us here.

1253
01:34:25,243 --> 01:34:26,744
To suffocate.

1254
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:30,248
To starve.

1255
01:34:57,609 --> 01:34:58,943
Frozen cloud.

1256
01:37:23,379 --> 01:37:24,756
It's okay.

1257
01:37:24,922 --> 01:37:26,341
It's okay.

1258
01:37:33,181 --> 01:37:34,682
It's okay.

1259
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:42,106
Pray you never learn...

1260
01:37:43,274 --> 01:37:46,611
...just how good it can be
to see another face.

1261
01:37:55,036 --> 01:37:57,538
I hadn't a lot of hope
to begin with, but...

1262
01:37:57,705 --> 01:38:00,041
...after so long, I had none.

1263
01:38:01,709 --> 01:38:04,545
My supplies were completely exhausted.

1264
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:10,259
The last time I went to sleep,
I didn't even set a waking date.

1265
01:38:13,971 --> 01:38:16,557
You have literally raised me from the dead.

1266
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,769
Lazarus.

1267
01:38:20,686 --> 01:38:23,940
- What about the others?
- I'm afraid you're it, sir.

1268
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:27,068
So far, surely.

1269
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:32,657
No, our present situation is that there's
very little chance of rescuing any others.

1270
01:38:36,411 --> 01:38:38,621
Dr. Mann. Dr. Mann?

1271
01:38:39,497 --> 01:38:41,290
Tell us about your world.

1272
01:38:44,669 --> 01:38:46,546
Our world, we hope.

1273
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:52,677
Our world is cold...

1274
01:38:52,844 --> 01:38:54,137
...stark...

1275
01:38:56,013 --> 01:38:57,849
...but undeniably beautiful.

1276
01:39:00,101 --> 01:39:03,354
The days are 67 hours long, cold.

1277
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:09,110
The nights are...

1278
01:39:09,277 --> 01:39:11,612
...67 far colder hours.

1279
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:21,789
The gravity is a very, very pleasant
80 percent of the Earth's.

1280
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:24,959
Now, up here where I landed,
the water is alkali...

1281
01:39:25,293 --> 01:39:29,046
...and the air has too much ammonia to
breathe for more than just a few minutes...

1282
01:39:29,213 --> 01:39:33,801
...but down at the surface,
and there is a surface...

1283
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:35,595
...the chlorine dissipates.

1284
01:39:35,761 --> 01:39:39,640
The ammonia gives way to crystalline
hydrocarbons and breathable air.

1285
01:39:39,974 --> 01:39:41,476
To organics.

1286
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:44,145
Possibly even to life.

1287
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:46,898
We might be sharing this world.

1288
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,400
These readings are from the surface?

1289
01:39:49,567 --> 01:39:52,737
Over the years,
I've dropped various probes.

1290
01:39:53,070 --> 01:39:56,491
- How far have you explored?
- I've mounted several major expeditions.

1291
01:39:56,657 --> 01:40:00,912
But with oxygen in limited supply,
KIPP there really did most of the legwork.

1292
01:40:01,078 --> 01:40:03,539
- What went wrong with him, sir?
- Degeneration.

1293
01:40:03,706 --> 01:40:07,293
He misidentified the first organics
we found as ammonia crystals.

1294
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:11,589
We struggled on for a time,
but ultimately I decommissioned him and...

1295
01:40:11,756 --> 01:40:13,925
...used his power source
to keep the mission going.

1296
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:17,094
I thought I was alone
before I shut him down.

1297
01:40:17,261 --> 01:40:18,930
Would you like me to look at him?

1298
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:21,599
No. No. He needs a human touch.

1299
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:26,270
Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message
for you from the comm station.

1300
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:28,898
Okay. Be right there. Excuse me.

1301
01:40:40,910 --> 01:40:43,496
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.

1302
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:45,831
He had no pain.

1303
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,461
He was at peace.

1304
01:40:52,547 --> 01:40:54,382
I'm sorry for your loss.

1305
01:40:56,759 --> 01:40:57,802
Is that Murph?

1306
01:40:58,511 --> 01:41:00,972
She's... She's grown.

1307
01:41:01,138 --> 01:41:02,723
Brand, did you know?

1308
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:05,560
He told you, right?

1309
01:41:08,604 --> 01:41:09,897
You knew.

1310
01:41:11,649 --> 01:41:13,150
This was all a sham.

1311
01:41:14,193 --> 01:41:15,861
You left us here.

1312
01:41:17,989 --> 01:41:19,490
To suffocate.

1313
01:41:21,576 --> 01:41:22,952
To starve.

1314
01:41:26,289 --> 01:41:27,873
Did my father know too?

1315
01:41:30,459 --> 01:41:31,919
Dad?

1316
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:35,590
I just want to know...

1317
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:38,926
...if you left me here to die.

1318
01:41:41,512 --> 01:41:43,514
I just have to know.

1319
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:50,438
Cooper, my...

1320
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:53,858
My father dedicated...

1321
01:41:54,233 --> 01:41:59,238
...his whole life to Plan A.
I have no idea what she's talking about.

1322
01:42:00,948 --> 01:42:02,116
I do.

1323
01:42:07,246 --> 01:42:09,915
He never even hoped
to get the people off the Earth?

1324
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:12,335
No.

1325
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:20,217
But he's been trying to solve
the gravity equation for 40 years.

1326
01:42:20,718 --> 01:42:24,138
Amelia, your father solved his equation
before I even left.

1327
01:42:24,722 --> 01:42:26,599
Then why wouldn't he use it?

1328
01:42:26,766 --> 01:42:30,728
The equation couldn't reconcile relativity
with quantum mechanics. You need more.

1329
01:42:30,895 --> 01:42:32,813
More? More what?

1330
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:35,983
More data.
You need to see into a black hole.

1331
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:38,235
The laws of nature prohibit
a naked singularity.

1332
01:42:38,402 --> 01:42:39,904
Romilly, is that true?

1333
01:42:41,197 --> 01:42:44,909
If a black hole is an oyster,
then the singularity's the pearl inside.

1334
01:42:45,076 --> 01:42:47,828
The gravity's so strong,
it's always hidden in darkness...

1335
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:49,413
...behind the horizon.

1336
01:42:50,831 --> 01:42:52,917
That's why we call it a black hole.

1337
01:42:53,084 --> 01:42:56,504
Okay, but if we see beyond the horizon...

1338
01:42:57,088 --> 01:42:58,589
We can't, Coop.

1339
01:42:58,756 --> 01:43:01,258
There are some things
that aren't meant to be known.

1340
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:05,638
Your father had to find another way
to save the human race from extinction.

1341
01:43:05,805 --> 01:43:07,306
Plan B. A colony.

1342
01:43:07,473 --> 01:43:09,141
Why not tell people?

1343
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:13,813
- Why keep building those stations?
- He knew how hard it would be...

1344
01:43:13,979 --> 01:43:18,109
...to get people to work together
to save the species instead of themselves.

1345
01:43:18,275 --> 01:43:19,443
Or their children.

1346
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:20,653
Bullshit.

1347
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:23,614
You never would've come
unless you believed you would save them.

1348
01:43:23,781 --> 01:43:26,992
Evolution has yet to transcend
that simple barrier.

1349
01:43:27,159 --> 01:43:29,620
We can care deeply, selflessly about...

1350
01:43:29,787 --> 01:43:33,290
...those we know, but that empathy
rarely extends beyond our line of sight.

1351
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:35,167
But the lie.

1352
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:40,881
That monstrous lie?

1353
01:43:42,133 --> 01:43:43,426
Unforgivable.

1354
01:43:43,592 --> 01:43:45,052
And he knew that.

1355
01:43:45,803 --> 01:43:50,141
He was prepared to destroy his own humanity
in order to save the species.

1356
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:52,727
- He made an incredible sacrifice.
- No.

1357
01:43:54,145 --> 01:43:59,024
An incredible sacrifice is being made
by the people on Earth who are gonna die!

1358
01:43:59,483 --> 01:44:01,652
Because in his fucking arrogance...

1359
01:44:02,069 --> 01:44:04,155
...he declared their case hopeless.

1360
01:44:04,822 --> 01:44:06,323
I'm sorry, Cooper...

1361
01:44:06,866 --> 01:44:08,325
...their case is hopeless.

1362
01:44:08,492 --> 01:44:10,619
No. No.

1363
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:12,747
We are the future.

1364
01:44:16,417 --> 01:44:18,335
Cooper, what can I do?

1365
01:44:21,547 --> 01:44:23,382
Let me go home.

1366
01:44:23,966 --> 01:44:25,885
You're absolutely positive?

1367
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:29,013
His solution was correct.
He'd had it for years.

1368
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:32,308
- It's worthless?
- It's half the answer.

1369
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:36,270
Okay, how do you find the other half?

1370
01:44:36,854 --> 01:44:38,522
Out there? A black hole.

1371
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:41,525
- But stuck down here on Earth?
- Yeah?

1372
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:44,528
I'm not sure you can.

1373
01:44:46,447 --> 01:44:49,116
God, they just pack up and leave.

1374
01:44:50,534 --> 01:44:52,620
What are they hoping to find?

1375
01:44:53,204 --> 01:44:54,246
Survival.

1376
01:45:02,046 --> 01:45:03,130
Damn it.

1377
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:09,845
Murph, don't...?
Don't people have a right to know?

1378
01:45:10,471 --> 01:45:14,558
Panic won't help.
We just have to keep working, same as ever.

1379
01:45:14,725 --> 01:45:18,062
But isn't that exactly what Professor Brand
was manipulating us to do?

1380
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:21,482
Brand gave up on us.
I'm still trying to solve this.

1381
01:45:22,107 --> 01:45:23,192
So...

1382
01:45:24,610 --> 01:45:26,278
...do you have an idea?

1383
01:45:26,987 --> 01:45:28,322
A feeling.

1384
01:45:31,742 --> 01:45:33,744
I told you about my ghost.

1385
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:37,790
My dad thought I called it a ghost...

1386
01:45:38,249 --> 01:45:39,917
...because I was scared of it.

1387
01:45:43,379 --> 01:45:44,713
But I was never scared of it.

1388
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:49,593
I called it a ghost because it felt...

1389
01:45:52,012 --> 01:45:53,681
It felt like a person.

1390
01:45:56,225 --> 01:45:57,893
It was trying to tell me something.

1391
01:46:00,855 --> 01:46:03,858
If there's an answer here on Earth,
it's back there...

1392
01:46:04,316 --> 01:46:06,235
...somehow, in that room.

1393
01:46:06,777 --> 01:46:08,529
So I have to find it.

1394
01:46:11,949 --> 01:46:13,701
We're running out of time.

1395
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:17,621
What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?

1396
01:46:17,788 --> 01:46:19,957
No, they can stay.
I'll be sleeping anyway.

1397
01:46:20,124 --> 01:46:21,709
- Hey, Coop?
- Yeah?

1398
01:46:21,876 --> 01:46:23,878
I have a suggestion for
your return journey.

1399
01:46:24,044 --> 01:46:26,797
- Yeah, what's that?
- Have one last crack at the black hole.

1400
01:46:28,674 --> 01:46:30,259
I'm going home, Rom.

1401
01:46:30,426 --> 01:46:33,679
Yeah, I know.
This isn't going to cost you any time.

1402
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:36,265
There's a chance for the people on Earth.

1403
01:46:37,016 --> 01:46:40,060
- Talk to me.
- Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.

1404
01:46:40,227 --> 01:46:44,106
- It's what we call a gentle singularity.
- Gentle?

1405
01:46:44,273 --> 01:46:47,735
They're hardly gentle.
But the tidal gravity is so quick that...

1406
01:46:47,902 --> 01:46:52,156
...something crossing the horizon fast
might survive. A probe, say.

1407
01:46:52,323 --> 01:46:56,994
- What happens after it crosses?
- After the horizon is a complete mystery.

1408
01:46:57,161 --> 01:47:00,247
So, what's to say
there isn't some way that the probe...

1409
01:47:00,414 --> 01:47:03,334
...can glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

1410
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:06,754
If he's equipped to transmit
every form of energy that can pulse.

1411
01:47:06,921 --> 01:47:09,715
Just when did this probe
become a "he," professor?

1412
01:47:10,257 --> 01:47:12,009
TARS is the obvious candidate.

1413
01:47:12,843 --> 01:47:14,762
I've already told him what to look for.

1414
01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:17,640
I'd need the old optical transmitter
off KIPP, Cooper.

1415
01:47:17,806 --> 01:47:19,141
You'd do this for us?

1416
01:47:19,308 --> 01:47:23,228
Before you get all teary, remember that
as a robot I have to do anything you say.

1417
01:47:24,146 --> 01:47:25,606
Your cue light's broken.

1418
01:47:25,773 --> 01:47:27,316
I'm not joking.

1419
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:33,197
I'll need TARS to remove and adapt
some components from KIPP.

1420
01:47:33,364 --> 01:47:35,699
I don't want to disturb
his archival functions.

1421
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:37,368
I'll supervise.

1422
01:47:37,701 --> 01:47:38,744
All right.

1423
01:47:38,911 --> 01:47:43,582
Dr. Mann, we need to find three secure sites.
One for Brand's lab, two for habitat.

1424
01:47:43,749 --> 01:47:46,210
Once those modules have landed,
you don't want to move them.

1425
01:47:46,377 --> 01:47:48,921
I can take you to the probe sites,
but I don't think...

1426
01:47:49,088 --> 01:47:51,799
...these conditions will hold.
I think we should wait.

1427
01:47:51,966 --> 01:47:54,802
CASE is headed down
with the rest of the distillery equipment.

1428
01:47:54,969 --> 01:47:57,805
I'd really like to secure
those sites by nightfall.

1429
01:47:59,723 --> 01:48:02,810
Well, these squalls do usually blow over.

1430
01:48:03,227 --> 01:48:04,353
Okay, then.

1431
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:06,730
- You'll need a long-range transmitter.
- Got it.

1432
01:48:06,897 --> 01:48:08,440
- Are you charged?
- Yeah.

1433
01:48:09,024 --> 01:48:10,067
Follow me.

1434
01:48:10,859 --> 01:48:13,028
TARS, 72 hours, yeah?

1435
01:48:13,195 --> 01:48:14,405
Roger that, Cooper.

1436
01:48:20,703 --> 01:48:23,747
Brand told me why you feel
you have to go back.

1437
01:48:25,582 --> 01:48:28,335
But I'd be remiss
if I didn't at least mention...

1438
01:48:28,669 --> 01:48:32,840
...that a mission such as ours
could certainly use an extra engineer.

1439
01:48:34,675 --> 01:48:38,929
You better slow down, turbo.
Safety first, CASE, remember.

1440
01:48:39,555 --> 01:48:41,306
Safety first, Cooper.

1441
01:48:42,558 --> 01:48:45,561
I have to tell you, Dr. Mann,
I'm honored to be a part of this.

1442
01:48:45,936 --> 01:48:50,941
But once we set up base camp and secure
those modules, my work's done here.

1443
01:48:51,358 --> 01:48:52,693
I'm going home.

1444
01:49:00,701 --> 01:49:04,204
You have attachments.
But even without a family...

1445
01:49:04,621 --> 01:49:09,084
...I can promise you that that yearning
to be with other people is powerful.

1446
01:49:09,752 --> 01:49:13,088
That emotion is at the foundation...

1447
01:49:13,756 --> 01:49:16,800
...of what makes us human.
It's not to be taken lightly.

1448
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:27,394
- How long have you had that cough?
- A while.

1449
01:49:37,946 --> 01:49:39,865
Mom lets me play in here.

1450
01:49:41,784 --> 01:49:43,035
I don't touch your stuff.

1451
01:50:14,024 --> 01:50:15,651
Just take this gently.

1452
01:50:20,781 --> 01:50:24,159
You know why we couldn't just send machines
on these missions, don't you?

1453
01:50:24,785 --> 01:50:29,414
A machine doesn't improvise well
because you can't program a fear of death.

1454
01:50:30,290 --> 01:50:32,626
Our survival instinct
is our single greatest...

1455
01:50:32,793 --> 01:50:36,338
...source of inspiration.
Take you, for example.

1456
01:50:37,047 --> 01:50:38,382
A father...

1457
01:50:38,882 --> 01:50:41,885
...with a survival instinct
that extends to your kids.

1458
01:50:43,053 --> 01:50:47,724
What does research tell us is the last thing
you're going to see before you die?

1459
01:50:49,434 --> 01:50:51,895
Your children. Their faces.

1460
01:50:52,229 --> 01:50:54,815
At the moment of death,
your mind's gonna push...

1461
01:50:54,982 --> 01:50:56,692
...a little bit harder to survive.

1462
01:50:57,401 --> 01:50:58,443
For them.

1463
01:50:59,319 --> 01:51:00,571
Deep breath.

1464
01:51:02,865 --> 01:51:06,618
Hey. I bet you're Coop.
Why don't you have a seat here for me?

1465
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:09,246
It's bad. They cannot stay here.

1466
01:51:09,955 --> 01:51:11,248
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1467
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:21,049
TARS, what's taking so long?

1468
01:51:21,216 --> 01:51:24,094
Professor, I am having trouble
completing the boot up.

1469
01:51:24,261 --> 01:51:25,804
I don't understand.

1470
01:51:32,603 --> 01:51:33,854
It's funny.

1471
01:51:35,939 --> 01:51:37,566
When I left Earth...

1472
01:51:38,567 --> 01:51:40,652
...I thought I was prepared to die.

1473
01:51:42,696 --> 01:51:44,031
The truth is...

1474
01:51:46,241 --> 01:51:51,246
...I never really considered the possibility
that my planet wasn't the one.

1475
01:51:53,957 --> 01:51:56,293
Nothing worked out the way
it was supposed to.

1476
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:57,502
Let's go.

1477
01:52:05,969 --> 01:52:08,764
All right, buddy,
give me a big deep breath.

1478
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:14,978
What is this?

1479
01:52:15,395 --> 01:52:19,233
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry! I can't let you leave with that ship.

1480
01:52:19,566 --> 01:52:21,902
We're gonna need it
to complete the mission...

1481
01:52:22,236 --> 01:52:25,656
...once the others realize
what this place isn't.

1482
01:52:25,948 --> 01:52:28,700
We cannot survive here. I'm sorry!

1483
01:52:29,159 --> 01:52:30,202
I'm sorry!

1484
01:52:39,962 --> 01:52:43,090
- They can't stay here anymore.
- You have to leave right now.

1485
01:52:43,257 --> 01:52:46,802
Let me make something abundantly clear.
You have a responsibility...

1486
01:52:46,969 --> 01:52:50,097
- Jesus!
- Coop, get her stuff. She's going home.

1487
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:52,349
Dad didn't raise you to be this dumb, Tom!

1488
01:52:52,516 --> 01:52:56,603
Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did.
And he's buried out back with Mom and Jesse.

1489
01:52:57,187 --> 01:52:59,856
You faked all the data?

1490
01:53:01,566 --> 01:53:02,651
Yeah.

1491
01:53:06,655 --> 01:53:08,365
There's no surface?

1492
01:53:08,532 --> 01:53:09,700
No.

1493
01:53:10,659 --> 01:53:12,661
I tried to do my duty, Cooper...

1494
01:53:12,828 --> 01:53:17,833
...but I knew the day that I arrived here
that this place had nothing.

1495
01:53:18,458 --> 01:53:22,254
And I resisted the temptation for years...

1496
01:53:22,879 --> 01:53:24,965
...but I knew that...

1497
01:53:25,299 --> 01:53:28,135
...if I just pressed that button, then...

1498
01:53:28,427 --> 01:53:30,429
...somebody would come and save me.

1499
01:53:31,471 --> 01:53:32,973
You fucking coward.

1500
01:53:33,807 --> 01:53:34,850
Yes.

1501
01:53:40,272 --> 01:53:41,315
Yes.

1502
01:53:43,233 --> 01:53:44,276
Yes.

1503
01:53:45,527 --> 01:53:46,570
Yes.

1504
01:53:58,081 --> 01:54:02,627
Listen, if you're not going to go,
let your family go. Just save your family.

1505
01:54:03,128 --> 01:54:05,422
And we go live underground with you?

1506
01:54:05,589 --> 01:54:07,507
Pray that Daddy comes to save us?

1507
01:54:07,674 --> 01:54:11,178
Dad's not coming back.
He never was coming back. It's up to me.

1508
01:54:11,345 --> 01:54:13,221
You're gonna save everybody?

1509
01:54:13,597 --> 01:54:16,433
- Because Dad couldn't do it.
- Dad didn't even try!

1510
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:18,769
Dad just abandoned us!

1511
01:54:19,519 --> 01:54:21,313
He left us here to die.

1512
01:54:22,022 --> 01:54:23,690
Nobody's going with you.

1513
01:54:27,402 --> 01:54:30,113
You gonna wait for your next kid to die?

1514
01:54:33,116 --> 01:54:34,409
Get out.

1515
01:54:35,285 --> 01:54:36,620
And don't come back.

1516
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:43,335
You can keep my stuff.

1517
01:54:54,262 --> 01:54:55,639
Stop it!

1518
01:54:58,642 --> 01:55:00,227
No. No!

1519
01:55:01,311 --> 01:55:04,189
Dr. Mann, there's a 50-50 chance
you're gonna kill yourself!

1520
01:55:05,023 --> 01:55:07,025
Those are the best odds I've had in years.

1521
01:55:27,462 --> 01:55:29,297
Don't judge me, Cooper.

1522
01:55:30,048 --> 01:55:32,300
You were never tested like I was.

1523
01:55:32,926 --> 01:55:34,386
Few men have been.

1524
01:55:42,727 --> 01:55:43,895
You tried your best, Murph.

1525
01:55:53,405 --> 01:55:54,781
You're feeling it, aren't you?

1526
01:55:56,450 --> 01:55:58,285
The survival instinct.

1527
01:55:59,202 --> 01:56:03,540
That's what drove me. It's what drives all of us.
And it's what's gonna save us.

1528
01:56:04,708 --> 01:56:08,044
Because I want to save all of us.
For you, Cooper.

1529
01:56:13,216 --> 01:56:16,761
I'm sorry, I can't watch you go through this.
I'm sorry.

1530
01:56:17,095 --> 01:56:19,764
I thought I could, but I can't.

1531
01:56:20,849 --> 01:56:23,018
I'm here. I'm here for you.

1532
01:56:23,310 --> 01:56:25,353
Just listen to my voice, Cooper.

1533
01:56:26,146 --> 01:56:27,481
I'm right here.

1534
01:56:29,316 --> 01:56:30,650
You're not alone.

1535
01:56:40,368 --> 01:56:41,870
Do you see your children?

1536
01:56:45,123 --> 01:56:46,458
It's okay.

1537
01:56:47,417 --> 01:56:49,169
They're right there with you.

1538
01:56:53,048 --> 01:56:55,634
Did Professor Brand tell you
that poem before you left?

1539
01:56:56,468 --> 01:56:57,969
Do you remember?

1540
01:57:00,347 --> 01:57:03,016
Do not go gentle into that good night

1541
01:57:04,935 --> 01:57:07,729
Old age should burn and rave

1542
01:57:07,896 --> 01:57:09,481
At close of day

1543
01:57:11,066 --> 01:57:13,443
Rage, rage against the dying of the light

1544
01:57:38,093 --> 01:57:39,761
Brand! Help!

1545
01:57:39,928 --> 01:57:41,888
- Help!
- Cooper?

1546
01:57:48,603 --> 01:57:49,813
CASE!

1547
01:57:50,188 --> 01:57:51,481
No air.

1548
01:57:52,315 --> 01:57:53,525
Ammonia.

1549
01:57:54,609 --> 01:57:57,112
Cooper. Cooper, we're coming! CASE!

1550
01:57:57,279 --> 01:57:59,197
- I have a fix.
- Go! Go, go, go!

1551
01:57:59,364 --> 01:58:01,449
And away!

1552
01:58:13,003 --> 01:58:15,213
Cooper, we're coming.
Hang in there. Don't talk.

1553
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:17,674
Try to breathe as little as possible.
We're almost there.

1554
01:58:21,344 --> 01:58:23,346
There's a security lockout, sir.

1555
01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:26,766
It requires a person to access function.

1556
01:58:31,813 --> 01:58:33,315
It's all yours, sir.

1557
01:58:41,531 --> 01:58:42,991
Try not to breathe.

1558
01:58:43,992 --> 01:58:45,660
We're coming. We're coming right now.

1559
01:58:45,827 --> 01:58:47,954
CASE, come on! Come on!

1560
01:58:48,121 --> 01:58:50,832
We got to go faster, CASE!
Faster, faster, faster!

1561
01:58:55,337 --> 01:58:57,047
Hang in there. Come on.

1562
01:59:03,553 --> 01:59:06,848
I see him, I see him!
CASE, bank! Bank right!

1563
01:59:25,867 --> 01:59:27,410
Cooper! Cooper!

1564
01:59:27,786 --> 01:59:28,870
I'm here!

1565
01:59:52,102 --> 01:59:54,104
This data makes no sense.

1566
02:00:02,529 --> 02:00:03,780
I'm sorry.

1567
02:00:04,114 --> 02:00:06,700
- What?
- Mann was lying!

1568
02:00:14,457 --> 02:00:16,251
Go. Go.

1569
02:00:17,335 --> 02:00:18,378
Romilly.

1570
02:00:18,753 --> 02:00:19,796
Romilly!

1571
02:00:20,130 --> 02:00:22,549
Romilly! Do you read me, Romilly?

1572
02:00:23,133 --> 02:00:25,135
Step back, professor! Step back!

1573
02:00:33,059 --> 02:00:35,645
- Romilly...
- Romilly, do you read me?

1574
02:00:38,648 --> 02:00:39,983
Keep watch!

1575
02:00:41,151 --> 02:00:42,277
Lois?

1576
02:00:42,777 --> 02:00:45,280
- What happened to caution, CASE?
- Safety first, Cooper.

1577
02:00:46,656 --> 02:00:50,076
Romilly? Romilly, do you read me?
This is Brand.

1578
02:00:52,954 --> 02:00:53,997
Romilly?

1579
02:00:54,164 --> 02:00:56,750
Dr. Brand. Cooper.
There's been an explosion.

1580
02:00:57,375 --> 02:00:59,169
Dr. Mann's compound.

1581
02:01:26,780 --> 02:01:28,823
TARS, TARS, 10 o'clock!

1582
02:01:35,205 --> 02:01:37,165
Let me know when TARS is aboard.

1583
02:01:40,794 --> 02:01:42,670
Romilly did not survive.

1584
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:45,548
I could not save him.

1585
02:01:45,715 --> 02:01:47,175
- TARS is in.
- I'll take her now.

1586
02:01:47,342 --> 02:01:50,220
- Do we have a fix on the Ranger?
- He's pushing into orbit!

1587
02:01:50,386 --> 02:01:53,389
If he takes control of
that ship, we're dead.

1588
02:01:54,599 --> 02:01:57,560
- He'd maroon us?
- He is marooning us.

1589
02:01:59,562 --> 02:02:02,065
I'll meet you guys downstairs.
Go wait by the car.

1590
02:02:09,906 --> 02:02:14,118
Come on! Give me your bag.
Get in the backseat. Get in the backseat now!

1591
02:02:19,749 --> 02:02:21,668
Dr. Mann, please respond.

1592
02:02:22,293 --> 02:02:24,379
Dr. Mann, please respond!

1593
02:02:24,546 --> 02:02:26,756
He doesn't know
the Endurance docking procedure.

1594
02:02:26,923 --> 02:02:29,425
- The autopilot does.
- Not since TARS disabled it.

1595
02:02:30,635 --> 02:02:31,678
Nice.

1596
02:02:31,845 --> 02:02:34,764
- What's your trust setting, TARS?
- Lower than yours apparently.

1597
02:02:38,393 --> 02:02:41,938
Do not attempt docking.
I repeat, do not attempt docking.

1598
02:02:42,105 --> 02:02:43,147
Please res...

1599
02:03:42,582 --> 02:03:44,959
Auto-docking sequence withheld.

1600
02:03:45,126 --> 02:03:47,795
- Override.
- Unauthorized.

1601
02:03:48,504 --> 02:03:49,839
Override.

1602
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:52,216
Unauthorized.

1603
02:03:56,346 --> 02:04:00,475
Do not attempt docking. I repeat,
do not attempt docking. Please resp...

1604
02:04:44,268 --> 02:04:46,437
Moving slowly toward the Endurance.

1605
02:05:10,962 --> 02:05:12,547
Imperfect contact.

1606
02:05:12,714 --> 02:05:14,757
- Override.
- Hatch lockout.

1607
02:05:22,557 --> 02:05:25,101
- Is he locked on yet?
- Imperfectly.

1608
02:05:26,936 --> 02:05:28,187
Dr. Mann, do not...

1609
02:05:49,667 --> 02:05:52,670
Hatch lockout disengaged.

1610
02:06:01,220 --> 02:06:04,724
Dr. Mann, do not,
I repeat, do not open the hatch.

1611
02:06:05,058 --> 02:06:06,934
I repeat, do not open the hatch.

1612
02:06:07,101 --> 02:06:09,937
If you open the hatch,
the airlock will depressurize.

1613
02:06:35,838 --> 02:06:38,132
- What happens if he blows the airlock?
- Nothing good.

1614
02:06:44,013 --> 02:06:46,641
Okay, pull back. Retro thrusters,
everything we've got, CASE!

1615
02:06:46,808 --> 02:06:48,518
- Thrusters are full!
- Back!

1616
02:06:48,684 --> 02:06:50,686
Relay my transmission
to the on board computer...

1617
02:06:50,853 --> 02:06:52,939
...and have it rebroadcast
as emergency P.A.

1618
02:06:53,106 --> 02:06:54,148
Dr. Mann...

1619
02:06:56,734 --> 02:06:59,612
I repeat, do not open
the inner hatch. I repeat...

1620
02:06:59,779 --> 02:07:00,822
Brand?

1621
02:07:01,656 --> 02:07:03,699
I don't know what he said to you...

1622
02:07:03,866 --> 02:07:06,536
...but I am taking command
of the Endurance.

1623
02:07:06,994 --> 02:07:09,038
And then we can talk
about completing the mission.

1624
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:14,210
Dr. Mann, listen to me.

1625
02:07:15,002 --> 02:07:17,004
This is not about my life.

1626
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:20,883
Or Cooper's life.
This is about all mankind.

1627
02:07:21,467 --> 02:07:22,885
There is a moment...

1628
02:07:29,225 --> 02:07:30,560
It is not sa...

1629
02:07:38,860 --> 02:07:39,902
Oh, my God.

1630
02:07:58,212 --> 02:08:02,175
- There's no point using fuel to chase...
- Analyze the Endurance's spin.

1631
02:08:07,430 --> 02:08:09,640
- Cooper, what are you doing?
- Docking.

1632
02:08:14,228 --> 02:08:17,064
Endurance rotation is 67, 68 RPM.

1633
02:08:17,231 --> 02:08:19,692
Okay, get ready to match our spin
with the retro thrusters.

1634
02:08:19,859 --> 02:08:21,944
- It's not possible.
- No...

1635
02:08:22,111 --> 02:08:23,279
...it's necessary.

1636
02:08:34,916 --> 02:08:37,084
Endurance is hitting stratosphere!

1637
02:08:41,130 --> 02:08:43,174
She's got no heat shield.

1638
02:08:46,302 --> 02:08:48,054
- CASE, you ready?
- Ready.

1639
02:08:56,479 --> 02:08:59,649
Cooper! This is no time for caution.

1640
02:09:01,192 --> 02:09:03,653
CASE, if I black out, you take the stick.

1641
02:09:03,819 --> 02:09:06,280
TARS, get ready to engage
the docking mechanism.

1642
02:09:13,329 --> 02:09:14,830
Endurance is starting to heat.

1643
02:09:14,997 --> 02:09:16,332
Twenty feet out.

1644
02:09:16,499 --> 02:09:19,001
I need three degrees starboard, Cooper.

1645
02:09:19,168 --> 02:09:21,170
Ten feet out.

1646
02:09:21,337 --> 02:09:23,839
Cooper, we are lined up.

1647
02:09:24,006 --> 02:09:25,591
Initiating spin!

1648
02:10:07,174 --> 02:10:08,384
Come on, TARS.

1649
02:10:16,642 --> 02:10:18,185
Come on, TARS!

1650
02:10:29,405 --> 02:10:31,824
- We are locked, Cooper.
- Locked. Easing up!

1651
02:10:39,707 --> 02:10:41,042
Easy.

1652
02:10:42,209 --> 02:10:43,544
Easy.

1653
02:10:49,383 --> 02:10:50,885
Retro thrusters!

1654
02:10:58,851 --> 02:11:00,353
Main engines on.

1655
02:11:06,108 --> 02:11:08,819
Pushing out of orbit. Come on, baby.

1656
02:11:16,827 --> 02:11:18,496
Killing main engines!

1657
02:11:19,747 --> 02:11:21,415
Okay, we're out of orbit.

1658
02:11:28,756 --> 02:11:31,634
Okay. And for our next trick!

1659
02:11:33,469 --> 02:11:37,306
It'll have to be good.
We're heading into Gargantua's pull.

1660
02:11:38,224 --> 02:11:39,266
Oh, shit.

1661
02:11:39,767 --> 02:11:41,560
- CASE, take the stick.
- Roger that.

1662
02:12:31,527 --> 02:12:33,863
Cooper, we're slipping towards Gargantua.

1663
02:12:35,197 --> 02:12:37,158
Shall I use main engines?

1664
02:12:37,324 --> 02:12:38,367
No.

1665
02:12:38,951 --> 02:12:41,203
We got to let her slide as far as we can.

1666
02:12:50,004 --> 02:12:52,882
- Give it to me.
- There's good news, there's bad news.

1667
02:12:53,048 --> 02:12:56,677
Yeah, I've heard that one, TARS.
Give it to me straight.

1668
02:13:05,519 --> 02:13:08,731
The backup generator kicked in,
so the system's stable. They're all good.

1669
02:13:08,898 --> 02:13:09,940
Good.

1670
02:13:10,357 --> 02:13:13,694
Okay. The navigational hub
has been completely destroyed.

1671
02:13:13,861 --> 02:13:16,822
We don't have enough life support
to make it back to Earth...

1672
02:13:16,989 --> 02:13:19,074
...but we can scratch our way
to Edmunds' planet.

1673
02:13:19,241 --> 02:13:20,576
What about fuel?

1674
02:13:20,993 --> 02:13:23,496
Not enough. But I have a plan.

1675
02:13:24,121 --> 02:13:28,125
We let Gargantua pull us down
close to her horizon.

1676
02:13:28,626 --> 02:13:31,879
Then a powered slingshot around,
launching us towards Edmunds' planet.

1677
02:13:32,046 --> 02:13:34,548
- Manually?
- That's what I'm here for.

1678
02:13:34,715 --> 02:13:37,426
I'm gonna take us just
inside the critical orbit.

1679
02:13:37,593 --> 02:13:40,095
- What about time slippage?
- Neither of us has time to worry...

1680
02:13:40,262 --> 02:13:41,931
...about relativity right now, Dr. Brand.

1681
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:48,062
I'm sorry, Cooper.

1682
02:13:51,190 --> 02:13:54,443
Once we've gathered
enough speed around Gargantua...

1683
02:13:54,777 --> 02:13:56,612
...we use Lander 1...

1684
02:13:57,112 --> 02:13:59,406
...and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters to...

1685
02:14:00,574 --> 02:14:02,576
...push us out of the black hole's gravity.

1686
02:14:04,912 --> 02:14:07,581
The Lander's linkages
have been destroyed...

1687
02:14:07,748 --> 02:14:10,084
...so we'll have to control manually.

1688
02:14:11,293 --> 02:14:14,755
Once Lander 1 is spent, TARS will detach...

1689
02:14:14,922 --> 02:14:16,632
And get sucked into that black hole.

1690
02:14:17,258 --> 02:14:19,218
Why does TARS have to detach?

1691
02:14:19,385 --> 02:14:21,428
We have to shed the weight
to escape the gravity.

1692
02:14:21,595 --> 02:14:22,972
Newton's third law.

1693
02:14:23,138 --> 02:14:25,849
The only way humans have ever
figured out of getting somewhere...

1694
02:14:26,016 --> 02:14:27,560
...is to leave something behind.

1695
02:14:27,726 --> 02:14:30,771
Cooper, you can't ask TARS
to do this for us.

1696
02:14:30,938 --> 02:14:34,775
He's a robot. So you don't have
to ask him to do anything.

1697
02:14:34,942 --> 02:14:36,235
Cooper, you asshole!

1698
02:14:36,610 --> 02:14:38,612
Sorry, you broke up a little bit there.

1699
02:14:38,862 --> 02:14:41,115
It's what we intended, Dr. Brand.

1700
02:14:41,448 --> 02:14:43,909
It's our only chance to
save people on Earth.

1701
02:14:44,076 --> 02:14:47,288
If I can find a way to transmit
the Quantum data I'll find in there...

1702
02:14:47,454 --> 02:14:49,290
...they might still make it.

1703
02:14:50,332 --> 02:14:52,960
Let's just hope
there's still someone there to save.

1704
02:15:21,447 --> 02:15:23,115
Maximum velocity achieved.

1705
02:15:24,366 --> 02:15:26,869
Prepare to fire escape thrusters.

1706
02:15:27,036 --> 02:15:28,120
Ready?

1707
02:15:28,287 --> 02:15:29,705
Ready.

1708
02:15:29,872 --> 02:15:31,040
Ready.

1709
02:15:31,206 --> 02:15:33,000
Main engine ignition in three...

1710
02:15:33,167 --> 02:15:34,335
...two...

1711
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:36,795
...one. Mark.

1712
02:15:50,225 --> 02:15:51,477
Come on, baby.

1713
02:15:52,645 --> 02:15:54,813
Lander 1 engines, on my mark.

1714
02:15:55,147 --> 02:15:56,190
Three...

1715
02:15:56,607 --> 02:15:57,733
...two...

1716
02:15:57,900 --> 02:15:59,401
...one. Mark.

1717
02:16:04,740 --> 02:16:07,326
Ranger 2 engines, on my mark.

1718
02:16:07,493 --> 02:16:09,870
Three, two, one...

1719
02:16:10,412 --> 02:16:11,580
- Mark.
- Fire!

1720
02:16:21,715 --> 02:16:24,885
This little maneuver's
gonna cost us 51 years!

1721
02:16:25,761 --> 02:16:28,263
You don't sound so bad for pushing 120!

1722
02:16:43,654 --> 02:16:46,824
Lander 1, prepare to detach on my mark.

1723
02:16:47,491 --> 02:16:49,493
Three, two...

1724
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:52,705
...one. Mark.

1725
02:16:52,871 --> 02:16:53,956
Detach!

1726
02:16:57,126 --> 02:16:59,628
- Goodbye, TARS.
- Goodbye, Dr. Brand.

1727
02:16:59,795 --> 02:17:02,798
- See you on the other side, Coop.
- See you there, Slick!

1728
02:17:11,306 --> 02:17:12,891
Okay, CASE.

1729
02:17:13,934 --> 02:17:17,312
- Nice reckless flying!
- Learned from the master.

1730
02:17:17,771 --> 02:17:20,357
- Ranger 2, prepare to detach.
- What?

1731
02:17:20,524 --> 02:17:23,444
No! No! Cooper! What are you doing?

1732
02:17:23,902 --> 02:17:27,614
Newton's third law.
You got to leave something behind.

1733
02:17:27,781 --> 02:17:30,200
You told me we had enough resources
for both of us.

1734
02:17:30,367 --> 02:17:32,119
We agreed, Amelia...

1735
02:17:32,494 --> 02:17:33,954
...90 percent.

1736
02:17:35,831 --> 02:17:36,915
Don't.

1737
02:17:39,126 --> 02:17:40,294
Detach.

1738
02:17:53,390 --> 02:17:56,143
Okay, I am nosing down.

1739
02:17:59,938 --> 02:18:01,940
Approaching the event horizon.

1740
02:18:04,193 --> 02:18:06,445
Portside, dipping down beneath it...

1741
02:18:07,029 --> 02:18:08,697
...to go through it.

1742
02:18:10,282 --> 02:18:13,118
Heading towards blackness.

1743
02:18:13,452 --> 02:18:15,454
I have a visual of the event.

1744
02:18:15,954 --> 02:18:17,331
It's all black.

1745
02:18:19,458 --> 02:18:21,126
TARS, do you read me?

1746
02:18:21,460 --> 02:18:22,961
It's all blackness.

1747
02:18:24,963 --> 02:18:26,965
TARS! Do you read me? Over.

1748
02:18:31,804 --> 02:18:32,971
Okay.

1749
02:18:34,181 --> 02:18:35,432
Screens...

1750
02:18:37,059 --> 02:18:38,560
...getting interference.

1751
02:18:40,270 --> 02:18:42,856
Losing control of the stick. I got flashes.

1752
02:18:43,440 --> 02:18:45,609
Flashes of lightness and blackness.

1753
02:18:46,819 --> 02:18:49,321
The turbulence in the
gravity is increasing.

1754
02:18:55,994 --> 02:18:58,831
The computers are going down.

1755
02:19:09,925 --> 02:19:12,761
Gravitational pull.
I'm losing control of the stick.

1756
02:19:46,128 --> 02:19:47,796
Murph? Murph, come on!

1757
02:19:53,468 --> 02:19:55,470
Eject. Eject.

1758
02:19:56,972 --> 02:19:58,056
Eject.

1759
02:19:58,473 --> 02:19:59,641
Eject.

1760
02:20:00,183 --> 02:20:01,226
Eject.

1761
02:20:01,935 --> 02:20:03,020
Eject.

1762
02:21:55,215 --> 02:21:56,258
Murph.

1763
02:22:06,226 --> 02:22:08,395
Murph! Murph! Murph!

1764
02:22:16,778 --> 02:22:17,821
Murph!

1765
02:22:25,037 --> 02:22:26,955
No, no, no!

1766
02:22:27,122 --> 02:22:28,415
Murph!

1767
02:22:28,582 --> 02:22:30,083
Murph!

1768
02:22:30,250 --> 02:22:31,293
No! No!

1769
02:23:30,977 --> 02:23:32,938
If you're leaving, just go.

1770
02:23:33,438 --> 02:23:34,606
No, no. No.

1771
02:23:36,191 --> 02:23:38,527
No, don't go. Don't go, you idiot.

1772
02:23:38,693 --> 02:23:39,986
Don't go!

1773
02:23:41,947 --> 02:23:43,615
Morse. Morse.

1774
02:23:44,366 --> 02:23:45,408
Morse.

1775
02:23:46,618 --> 02:23:48,411
Dot. Dot.

1776
02:23:48,578 --> 02:23:49,621
S.

1777
02:23:55,752 --> 02:23:56,795
T.

1778
02:24:01,383 --> 02:24:02,467
A.

1779
02:24:02,634 --> 02:24:03,718
Dash!

1780
02:24:06,513 --> 02:24:07,848
Dash! Dash!

1781
02:24:08,348 --> 02:24:09,391
Murph!

1782
02:24:09,558 --> 02:24:11,560
Murph, we don't have time for this!
Come on!

1783
02:24:11,977 --> 02:24:13,103
Y.

1784
02:24:18,400 --> 02:24:19,442
"Stay!"

1785
02:24:30,537 --> 02:24:32,873
Come on. Come on, Murph. Come on!

1786
02:24:33,540 --> 02:24:35,333
What's it say? What's it say, Murph?

1787
02:24:36,126 --> 02:24:37,210
What's it say?

1788
02:24:47,762 --> 02:24:48,889
"Stay."

1789
02:25:24,633 --> 02:25:26,092
Tell him, Murph.

1790
02:25:26,259 --> 02:25:27,469
Make him stay.

1791
02:25:30,805 --> 02:25:32,474
Make him stay, Murph.

1792
02:25:41,483 --> 02:25:43,360
Make him stay, Murph.

1793
02:25:44,819 --> 02:25:46,947
Don't let me leave, Murph!

1794
02:25:50,158 --> 02:25:52,577
Don't let me leave, Murph!

1795
02:25:58,375 --> 02:26:00,710
No! No! No!

1796
02:26:21,398 --> 02:26:22,899
It was you.

1797
02:26:34,369 --> 02:26:36,413
You were my ghost.

1798
02:26:46,131 --> 02:26:49,134
Cooper. Cooper. Come in, Cooper.

1799
02:26:50,927 --> 02:26:53,430
- TARS?
- Roger that.

1800
02:26:55,223 --> 02:26:57,851
- You survived.
- Somewhere...

1801
02:26:58,393 --> 02:27:00,437
...in their fifth dimension.

1802
02:27:00,603 --> 02:27:02,939
They saved us.

1803
02:27:03,106 --> 02:27:08,320
Yeah? Who the hell is "they"?
And just why would they want to help us?

1804
02:27:08,486 --> 02:27:11,197
I don't know, but they constructed
this three-dimensional space...

1805
02:27:11,364 --> 02:27:14,659
...inside their five-dimensional reality
to allow you to understand it.

1806
02:27:14,826 --> 02:27:16,786
Yeah, that ain't working.

1807
02:27:16,953 --> 02:27:18,496
Yes, it is.

1808
02:27:18,663 --> 02:27:22,542
You've seen that time is represented here
as a physical dimension.

1809
02:27:22,709 --> 02:27:25,545
You have worked out that you can exert
a force across space-time.

1810
02:27:26,212 --> 02:27:29,382
Gravity to send a message.

1811
02:27:29,758 --> 02:27:31,092
Affirmative.

1812
02:27:33,678 --> 02:27:34,804
Gravity...

1813
02:27:35,930 --> 02:27:39,267
...can cross the dimensions,
including time.

1814
02:27:39,601 --> 02:27:40,894
Apparently.

1815
02:27:44,773 --> 02:27:46,775
Do you have the quantum data?

1816
02:27:47,192 --> 02:27:48,818
Roger. I have it.

1817
02:27:49,778 --> 02:27:53,782
I am transmitting it on all wavelengths,
but nothing is getting out, Cooper.

1818
02:27:53,948 --> 02:27:56,201
I can do this. I can do this.

1819
02:27:56,659 --> 02:27:59,412
But such complicated data to a child?

1820
02:27:59,579 --> 02:28:00,705
Not just any child.

1821
02:28:00,872 --> 02:28:02,248
What else?

1822
02:28:02,791 --> 02:28:04,959
Come on, Dad.

1823
02:28:07,128 --> 02:28:09,297
Murph, the fire's out! Come on!

1824
02:28:09,464 --> 02:28:13,468
Even if you communicate it here,
she won't understand its significance for years.

1825
02:28:14,260 --> 02:28:15,720
I get that, TARS.

1826
02:28:15,887 --> 02:28:20,558
But we've got to figure something out
or the people on Earth are gonna die. Think!

1827
02:28:20,725 --> 02:28:22,310
Cooper...

1828
02:28:22,477 --> 02:28:24,979
...they didn't bring us here
to change the past.

1829
02:28:28,566 --> 02:28:30,068
Say that again.

1830
02:28:30,235 --> 02:28:33,696
They didn't bring us
here to change the past.

1831
02:28:38,118 --> 02:28:40,078
No, they didn't bring us here at all.

1832
02:28:44,707 --> 02:28:46,376
We brought ourselves.

1833
02:28:55,635 --> 02:28:59,681
TARS, give me the coordinates
for NASA in binary.

1834
02:29:00,223 --> 02:29:02,684
In binary. Roger. Feeding data.

1835
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:28,918
"It's not a ghost."

1836
02:29:30,670 --> 02:29:32,172
"It's gravity."

1837
02:29:32,505 --> 02:29:34,174
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

1838
02:29:34,841 --> 02:29:36,634
I brought myself here!

1839
02:29:37,510 --> 02:29:41,014
We're here to communicate
with the three-dimensional world.

1840
02:29:41,431 --> 02:29:42,932
We're the bridge!

1841
02:29:50,940 --> 02:29:52,734
I thought they chose me.

1842
02:29:56,070 --> 02:29:59,741
- But they didn't choose me, they chose her.
- For what, Cooper?

1843
02:30:02,243 --> 02:30:03,912
To save the world.

1844
02:30:08,208 --> 02:30:12,587
All of this is one little girl's bedroom.
Every moment.

1845
02:30:12,921 --> 02:30:14,339
It's infinitely complex.

1846
02:30:14,506 --> 02:30:19,260
They have access to infinite time and space,
but they're not bound by anything!

1847
02:30:19,427 --> 02:30:24,098
They can't find a specific place in time.
They can't communicate.

1848
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:28,603
That's why I'm here.
I'm gonna find a way to tell Murph...

1849
02:30:28,770 --> 02:30:30,271
...just like I found this moment.

1850
02:30:30,438 --> 02:30:32,774
- How, Cooper?
- Love, TARS, love.

1851
02:30:32,941 --> 02:30:37,362
It's just like Brand said. My connection
with Murph, it is quantifiable. It's the key!

1852
02:30:37,529 --> 02:30:39,405
What are we here to do?

1853
02:30:40,323 --> 02:30:42,200
Find how to tell her.

1854
02:30:44,994 --> 02:30:46,329
The watch.

1855
02:30:49,457 --> 02:30:50,625
The watch.

1856
02:30:52,001 --> 02:30:53,127
That's it.

1857
02:30:55,630 --> 02:30:58,633
We code the data into the movement
of the second hand.

1858
02:31:02,262 --> 02:31:05,473
TARS, translate the data into Morse
and feed it to me.

1859
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:09,936
Translating data to Morse.
Cooper, what if she never came back for it?

1860
02:31:11,604 --> 02:31:14,274
She will. She will.

1861
02:31:15,483 --> 02:31:17,110
Murph, I can see his car!

1862
02:31:18,319 --> 02:31:19,487
He's coming, Murph!

1863
02:31:21,322 --> 02:31:23,157
Okay. I'm coming down.

1864
02:31:24,617 --> 02:31:26,119
How do you know?

1865
02:31:29,330 --> 02:31:31,165
Because I gave it to her.

1866
02:31:36,546 --> 02:31:39,048
Roger. Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.

1867
02:31:42,552 --> 02:31:43,678
Dot-dot...

1868
02:31:45,013 --> 02:31:46,681
...dash-dot.

1869
02:31:47,140 --> 02:31:48,808
Dot-dash-dot-dot.

1870
02:31:49,183 --> 02:31:51,853
Dot-dash-dot-dot.

1871
02:31:52,353 --> 02:31:53,688
Dash-dash-dash.

1872
02:31:54,022 --> 02:31:56,274
Dash, dash, dash.

1873
02:32:14,542 --> 02:32:15,877
He came back!

1874
02:32:16,794 --> 02:32:20,965
It was him all the time!
I didn't know. It was him!

1875
02:32:22,050 --> 02:32:24,010
Dad's gonna save us.

1876
02:33:06,761 --> 02:33:08,012
Eureka!

1877
02:33:11,766 --> 02:33:13,101
It's traditional.

1878
02:33:17,689 --> 02:33:19,315
Eureka!

1879
02:33:24,028 --> 02:33:25,530
Did it work?

1880
02:33:25,697 --> 02:33:27,532
I think it might have.

1881
02:33:28,908 --> 02:33:30,201
How do you know?

1882
02:33:30,368 --> 02:33:33,746
Because the bulk beings
are closing the tesseract.

1883
02:33:37,583 --> 02:33:39,585
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

1884
02:33:40,753 --> 02:33:42,588
They're not "beings."

1885
02:33:43,256 --> 02:33:44,590
They're us.

1886
02:33:46,634 --> 02:33:49,762
What I've been doing for Murph,
they're doing for me.

1887
02:33:50,304 --> 02:33:51,806
For all of us.

1888
02:33:51,973 --> 02:33:54,225
Cooper, people couldn't build this.

1889
02:33:54,392 --> 02:33:56,769
No. No, not yet.

1890
02:33:57,145 --> 02:33:58,604
But one day.

1891
02:33:59,272 --> 02:34:02,483
Not you and me. But people.

1892
02:34:03,151 --> 02:34:07,196
A civilization that's evolved past
the four dimensions we know.

1893
02:34:13,786 --> 02:34:15,288
What happens now?

1894
02:35:17,892 --> 02:35:19,352
Mr. Cooper.

1895
02:35:23,564 --> 02:35:25,274
All right. Let's take it slow, sir.

1896
02:35:25,691 --> 02:35:27,819
Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.

1897
02:35:27,985 --> 02:35:33,032
Remember, you're no spring chicken anymore.
Actually, you are 124 years old.

1898
02:35:40,039 --> 02:35:41,374
Take it slow, sir.

1899
02:35:42,291 --> 02:35:44,585
You were extremely lucky.

1900
02:35:44,919 --> 02:35:48,256
The Rangers found you with only minutes
left in your oxygen supply.

1901
02:36:02,436 --> 02:36:03,771
Where am I?

1902
02:36:05,439 --> 02:36:06,983
Cooper Station.

1903
02:36:08,401 --> 02:36:09,944
Currently orbiting Saturn.

1904
02:36:11,946 --> 02:36:13,990
Cooper Station.

1905
02:36:16,450 --> 02:36:18,452
Nice of you to name it after me.

1906
02:36:22,290 --> 02:36:23,374
What?

1907
02:36:23,541 --> 02:36:26,752
The station isn't named after you, sir.
It's named after your daughter.

1908
02:36:27,253 --> 02:36:30,256
Although she's always maintained
just how important you were.

1909
02:36:30,423 --> 02:36:32,133
Is she still alive?

1910
02:36:34,093 --> 02:36:35,970
She'll be here in a couple weeks.

1911
02:36:37,013 --> 02:36:39,473
She is far too old to be transferring
from another station...

1912
02:36:39,640 --> 02:36:42,018
...but when she heard
that you'd been found...

1913
02:36:43,227 --> 02:36:45,938
...well, this is Murphy Cooper
we're talking about.

1914
02:36:46,814 --> 02:36:48,316
Yes, it is.

1915
02:36:50,443 --> 02:36:52,945
We'll have you checked out of here
in a couple days.

1916
02:36:55,615 --> 02:36:58,117
I'm sure you'll be excited to see
what's in store.

1917
02:36:59,368 --> 02:37:03,331
I actually did a paper on you
in high school.

1918
02:37:03,664 --> 02:37:06,000
I know all about your life back on Earth.

1919
02:37:07,668 --> 02:37:08,836
Yeah.

1920
02:37:09,003 --> 02:37:10,254
Right.

1921
02:37:12,673 --> 02:37:18,012
If... If you'll follow me,
we've got a really good situation for you.

1922
02:37:21,349 --> 02:37:25,394
So when I made my suggestion
to Miss Cooper...

1923
02:37:26,312 --> 02:37:29,106
...I was delighted to hear
that she thought it was perfect.

1924
02:37:32,485 --> 02:37:35,780
It was just constant.
Just that steady blow of dirt.

1925
02:37:35,947 --> 02:37:38,866
Of course,
I didn't speak to her personally.

1926
02:37:39,033 --> 02:37:41,035
We always set the plate upside-down.

1927
02:37:41,202 --> 02:37:43,955
Glasses or cups,
whatever it was, upside-down.

1928
02:37:44,121 --> 02:37:49,043
Well, my dad was a farmer.
Like everybody else back then.

1929
02:37:49,210 --> 02:37:51,671
There just wasn't enough food.

1930
02:37:51,837 --> 02:37:54,548
We wore little things, little strips...

1931
02:37:54,715 --> 02:37:59,887
...of sheet over our nose and mouth
so we wouldn't breathe so much of it.

1932
02:38:00,054 --> 02:38:03,516
Well, it was pretty exciting for me
because it was hope.

1933
02:38:03,683 --> 02:38:07,895
I don't care who describes it, there is no way
for it to be exaggerated. It was that bad.

1934
02:38:08,062 --> 02:38:11,732
She did confirm
just how much you loved farming.

1935
02:38:12,066 --> 02:38:13,734
- She did, did she?
- Yeah.

1936
02:38:13,901 --> 02:38:15,111
Come here.

1937
02:38:15,695 --> 02:38:20,658
Home sweet home.
Everything replaced and put back where it...

1938
02:38:27,039 --> 02:38:29,083
- Hey, is this...?
- Yeah.

1939
02:38:29,250 --> 02:38:32,253
The machine we found out near Saturn
when we found you. Yes.

1940
02:38:32,420 --> 02:38:35,089
Its power source was shot,
but we could get you another one.

1941
02:38:35,256 --> 02:38:37,425
Yes. Please.

1942
02:38:38,634 --> 02:38:39,969
Settings.

1943
02:38:40,428 --> 02:38:41,929
General settings.

1944
02:38:42,430 --> 02:38:44,265
Security settings.

1945
02:38:46,976 --> 02:38:49,270
Honesty, new setting:

1946
02:38:50,438 --> 02:38:52,064
95 percent.

1947
02:38:52,398 --> 02:38:54,900
Confirmed. Additional customization?

1948
02:38:55,776 --> 02:38:56,902
Humor:

1949
02:38:58,404 --> 02:38:59,905
75 percent.

1950
02:39:00,281 --> 02:39:01,615
Confirmed.

1951
02:39:02,283 --> 02:39:05,411
Auto self-destruct T-minus 10, nine...

1952
02:39:05,578 --> 02:39:07,496
Let's make that 60 percent.

1953
02:39:09,790 --> 02:39:11,917
Sixty percent confirmed.

1954
02:39:12,543 --> 02:39:15,629
- Knock-knock.
- You want 55?

1955
02:39:20,509 --> 02:39:22,636
Is this really what it was like?

1956
02:39:24,847 --> 02:39:27,266
It was never this clean, Slick.

1957
02:39:31,771 --> 02:39:35,441
I don't care much for this pretending
we're back where we started.

1958
02:39:37,526 --> 02:39:39,820
I want to know where we are.

1959
02:39:41,447 --> 02:39:42,990
Where we're going.

1960
02:39:47,536 --> 02:39:50,623
- Mr. Cooper. The family's all in there.
- Yeah.

1961
02:39:50,790 --> 02:39:51,874
Family?

1962
02:39:52,041 --> 02:39:55,920
Yeah, they all came out to see her.
She's been in cryo-sleep for almost two years.

1963
02:40:28,994 --> 02:40:30,871
You told them I like farming.

1964
02:40:36,836 --> 02:40:38,504
It was me, Murph.

1965
02:40:40,965 --> 02:40:42,758
I was your ghost.

1966
02:40:44,051 --> 02:40:45,678
I know.

1967
02:40:47,471 --> 02:40:52,184
People didn't believe me.
They thought that I was doing it all myself.

1968
02:40:52,351 --> 02:40:53,394
But...

1969
02:40:56,272 --> 02:40:58,232
...I knew who it was.

1970
02:41:03,195 --> 02:41:05,364
Nobody believed me.

1971
02:41:05,865 --> 02:41:08,284
But I knew you'd come back.

1972
02:41:10,870 --> 02:41:12,079
How?

1973
02:41:14,081 --> 02:41:17,209
Because my dad promised me.

1974
02:41:23,257 --> 02:41:25,259
Well, I'm here now, Murph.

1975
02:41:26,552 --> 02:41:27,887
I'm here.

1976
02:41:29,346 --> 02:41:30,681
No.

1977
02:41:32,766 --> 02:41:36,896
No parent should have to watch
their own child die.

1978
02:41:39,815 --> 02:41:42,484
I have my kids here for me now.

1979
02:41:45,279 --> 02:41:46,780
You go.

1980
02:41:49,700 --> 02:41:51,202
Where?

1981
02:41:54,705 --> 02:41:56,290
Brand.

1982
02:42:06,133 --> 02:42:07,760
She's out there...

1983
02:42:14,183 --> 02:42:15,935
...setting up camp.

1984
02:42:42,419 --> 02:42:44,129
Alone...

1985
02:42:45,297 --> 02:42:47,967
...in a strange galaxy.

1986
02:42:58,852 --> 02:43:03,524
Maybe right now
she's settling in for the long nap...

1987
02:43:21,875 --> 02:43:24,712
...by the light of our new sun...

1988
02:43:40,185 --> 02:43:42,229
...in our new home.
