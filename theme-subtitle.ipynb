the organization order permission to treat the witness as hostile granted hostile i will show you hostile carbon fiber caliber made in china if you wanna kill a public servant mr maroni i recommend you buy american get him out of here but your honor i am not done we will never be able to link the gun to maroni so we can not charge him but they are trying to kill you means we are getting to them i am glad you are so pleased rachel i am fine by the way come on harvey you are gotham is da you are not getting shot at you are not doing your job right but you know if you said you were rattled we could take the rest of the day off can not i dragged the head of the major crimes unit down here oh jim gordon he is a friend actually try to be nice i hear you got a hell of a right cross it is a shame sal is going to walk yeah well good thing about the mob is they keep giving you second chances lightly irradiated bills fancy stuff for a city cop have help we liaise with various agencies save it gordon i wanna meet him official policy is to arrest the vigilante known as batman on sight what about that floodlight on the top of mcu if you got problems with malfunctioning equipment i suggest you take them up with maintenance counselor i have put every money launderer in gotham behind bars but the mob is still getting its money out i think you and your friend have found the last game in town you are trying to hit them where it hurts their wallets it is bold you gonna count me in in this town the fewer people know something the safer the operation i do not like that you got your own special unit and it is full of cops i investigated at internal affairs if i did not work with cops you would investigated while at ia i would be working alone i do not get political points for being an idealist i do the best i can with what i have you want me to back warrants for search and seizure on five banks without telling me what we are after i can give you the names of the banks well that is a start i will get you your warrants but i want your trust oh you do not have to sell me dent we all know you are gotham is white knight yeah well i heard they have a different name for me down at mcu i would not know about that in china lau security investments stands for dynamic new growth a joint chinese venture with wayne enterprises will be a powerhouse well mr lau i speak for the rest of the board and mr wayne in expressing our own excitement sir i know mr wayne is curious about how his trust fund gets replenished but frankly this is embarrassing you worry about the diligence mr reese i will worry about bruce wayne it is done the numbers are solid do them again would not want the trust fund to run out now would we another long night this joint venture was your idea and the consultants love it but i am not convinced lau is company has grown by percent annually like clockwork his revenue stream must be off the books maybe even illegal okay cancel the deal you already knew just needed a closer look at their books anything else you can trouble me for i need a new suit yeah three buttons is a little ' s mr wayne i am not talking fashion mr fox so much as function you wanna be able to turn your head sure make backing out of the driveway easier i will see what i can do took three weeks to get a reservation here i had to tell them i work for the government really health inspector is not afraid to pull strings rachel fancy that yeah bruce fancy that rachel natascha natascha rachel natascha are you the prima prima ballerina for the moscow ballet wow harvey is taking me next week really so you are into ballet bruce this is harvey dent the famous bruce wayne rachel is told me everything about you i certainly hope not let is put a couple tables together i am not sure that they will let us oh they should i own the place how could you want to raise children in a city like this well i was raised here i turned out okay is wayne manor in the city limits is the palisades sure you know as our new da you might wanna figure out where your jurisdiction ends i am talking about the kind of city that idolizes a masked vigilante gotham city is proud of an ordinary citizen standing up for what is right gotham needs heroes like you elected officials not a man who thinks he is above the law who appointed the batman we did all of us who stood by and let scum take control of our city but this is a democracy harvey when their enemies were at the gates the romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city it was not considered an honor it was a public service harvey the last man that they appointed to protect the republic was named caesar and he never gave up his power okay fine you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain whoever the batman is he does not wanna do this for the rest of his life how could he batman is looking for someone to take up his mantle someone like you mr dent maybe if i am up to it what if harvey dent is the caped crusader if i were sneaking out every night someone would have noticed by now well i am sold dent and i am gonna throw you a fundraiser that is nice but i am not up for reelection for three years no you do not understand one fundraiser with my pals you will never need another cent what the hell is this as you are all aware one of our deposits was stolen a relatively small amount million who is stupid enough to steal from us two bit wackjob wears a cheap purple suit and makeup he is not the problem he is a nobody the problem is our money being tracked by the cops thanks to mr maroni is well placed sources we know that police have indeed identified our banks using marked bills and are planning to seize your funds today and since the enthusiastic new da has put all my competitors out of business i am your only option so what are you proposing moving all deposits to one secure location not a bank where then no one can know but me if the police were to gain leverage over one of you everyone is money would be at stake what stop them getting to you i go to hong kong far from dent is jurisdiction and the chinese will not extradite one of their own how soon can you move the money i already have for obvious reasons i could not wait for your permission rest assured your money is safe and i thought my jokes were bad give me one reason why i should not have my boy pull your head off how about a magic trick i am gonna make this pencil disappear ta da it is it is gone oh and by the way the suit it was not cheap you ought to know you bought it sit i want to hear proposition let is wind the clocks back a year these cops and lawyers would not dare cross any of you i mean what happened did your balls drop off hm you see a guy like me a freak damn right a guy like me look listen i know why you choose to have your little ahem group therapy sessions in broad daylight i know why you are afraid to go out at night the batman see batman has shown gotham your true colors unfortunately dent he is just the beginning and as for the television is so called plan batman has no jurisdiction he will find him and make him squeal i know the squealers when i see them and what do you propose it is simple we uh kill the batman if it is so simple why have not you done it already if you are good at something never do it for free how much you want uh half you are crazy no i am not no i am not if we do not deal with this now soon little gambol here will not be able to get a nickel for his grandma enough from the clown ah ta ta ta let is not blow shit this out of proportion you think you can steal from us and just walk away yeah i am putting the word out five hundred grand for this clown dead a million alive so i can teach him some manners first all right so listen why do not you give me a call when you wanna start taking things a little more seriously here is my card you are a hard man to reach lau is halfway to hong kong if you would have asked i could have taken his passport all that was left in the vaults were marked bills they knew we were coming as soon as your office got involved my office you are sitting down there with scum like wuertz and ramirez and you are talking oh yeah i almost had your rookie cold on a racketeering beat do not try and cloud the fact that clearly maroni is got people in your office dent we need lau back but the chinese will not extradite a national under any circumstances if i get him to you can you get him to talk i will get him to sing we are going after the mob is life savings things will get ugly i knew the risk when i took this job lieutenant how will you get him back any he does that our chinese friends left town before i could tell them the deal was off well i am sure that you have always wanted to go to hong kong what is wrong with a phone call i think mr lau deserves a more personal touch now for high altitude jumps you are going to need oxygen and stabilizers well i must say compared to your usual requests jumping out of an airplane is pretty straightforward what about getting back into the plane i would recommend a good travel agent without it landing now that is more like it mr wayne the cia had a program back in the ' s for getting their people out of hot spots called sky hook we could look into that yeah okay now hardened kevlar plates over titanium dipped tri weave fibers for flexibility you will be lighter faster more agile perhaps you should read the instructions first yeah now there is a tradeoff separation of the plates makes you more vulnerable to knives and gunfire we would not wanna make things too easy now would we how will it hold up against dogs we talking rottweilers or chihuahuas should do fine against cats i found one in arizona a very nice man said he could have it up and running in a week and he takes cash what about the flight crew south korean smugglers they run flights into pyongyang below radar did you think of an alibi oh yes i believe this is your plane sir you look tired alfred you will be all right without me if you can tell me the russian for apply your own bloody suntan lotion yo gambol somebody here for you they say they have just killed the joker they brought the body so dead that is how about alive you wanna know how i got these scars my father was a drinker and a fiend and one night he goes off crazier than usual mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself he does not like that not one bit so me watching he takes the knife to her laughing while he does it he turns to me and he says: why so serious he comes at me with the knife why so serious he sticks the blade in my mouth let is put a smile on that face and why so serious now our operation is small but there is a lot of potential for aggressive expansion so which of you fine gentlemen would like to join our team oh there is only one spot open right now so we are gonna have tryouts make it fast welcome to hong kong mr fox mr lau regrets he is unable to greet you in person today i understand for security purposes i am gonna have to ask you to check in your mobile of course i must apologize for leaving gotham in the middle of our negotiations this misunderstanding with the gotham police force i could not let it threaten my company of course a businessman of your stature will understand and with you here now we can continue well i do appreciate you bringing me out here in such style mr lau but i re we do not allow cell phones in here i am sorry forgot i had it no i really came to tell you that our business deal has to be put on hold you see we can not afford to be seen to do business with whatever it is you are accused of being i am sure a businessman of your stature will understand i think mr fox a simple phone call might have sufficed mr wayne did not want you to think he was deliberately wasting your time just accidentally wasting it that is very good mr lau accidentally very good hey sir there is a better view from the peak tram how is the view from lsi holdings restricted lau is holed up in there good and tight what is this i had r&d work it up sends out a high frequency pulse records the response time for mapping an environment sonar just like a submarine mr wayne like a submarine and the other device it is in place mr wayne good luck look give us the money and we will talk about making a deal the money is the only reason i am still alive oh you mean when they find out that you have helped us they are gonna kill you are you threatening my client no i am just assuming your client is cooperation with this investigation as will everyone no okay enjoy your time in county mr lau wait i will not give you the money but i will give you my clients all of them you were a glorified accountant what could you possibly have on all of them that we could charge i am good with calculation i handled all their investments one big pot got it one minute rico if they pooled their money we can charge them as one criminal conspiracy charge them with what in a rico case if you can charge one of them with a felony you can charge all of them with it that is great mr lau what kind of details do you have about this communal fund ledgers immunity protection a chartered plane back to hong kong after you testify in open court i am just curious with all your clients locked up what is gonna happen with all that money like i said i am good with calculation he can not go to county i will keep him here in the holding cells what is this gordon your fortress well you trust them over at county i do not trust them here lau stays well i do not know about mr lau is travel arrangements but i am sure glad he is back put word out we hire the clown he was right we have to fix real problem batman i am not aware of any participation our boy looks good on the tube you sure you wanna embarrass me in front of my friends oh do not worry they are coming too have a nice trip see you next fall seven hundred twelve counts of extortion eight hundred and forty nine counts of racketeering two hundred and forty six counts of fraud eighty seven counts of conspiracy murder five hundred and twenty seven counts of obstruction of justice how do the defendants plead order in the court five hundred and forty nine criminals at once how did you convince surrillo to hear this farce she shares my enthusiasm for justice after all she is a judge even if you blow enough smoke to get convictions out of surrillo you are gonna set a new record at appeals it will not matter the head guys make bail sure but the midlevel guys they can not they can not afford to be off the streets they will cut deals that include some jail time think of all you could do with months of clean streets mr mayor you can not no get out both of you sit down the public likes you that is the only reason that this might fly but that means it is on you they are all gonna come after you now and not just the mob politicians journalists cops anyone whose wallet is about to get lighter are you up to it you would better be because they get anything on you and those criminals are back on the streets followed swiftly by you and me jesus i think your fundraiser will be a great success sir and why do you think i wanna hold a party for harvey dent i assumed it was your usual reason for socializing beyond myself and the scum of gotham is underbelly: to try to impress miss dawes very droll but very wrong actually it is dent police released video footage found concealed on the body sensitive viewers be aware the image is disturbing tell them your name brian douglas and are you the real batman no no no no then why do you dress up like him because he is a symbol that we do not have to be afraid of scum like you yeah you do brian you really do huh yeah so you think batman is made gotham a better place hm look at me look at me you see this is how crazy batman is made gotham you want order in gotham batman must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he does not people will die starting tonight i am a man of my word harvey dent scourge of the underworld scared stiff by the trust fund brigade i will be back rachel a little liquid courage mr dent thank you alfred right that is right sir rachel talks about you all the time you have known her her whole life not yet sir any psychotic ex boyfriends i should be aware of oh you have no idea i am sorry that i am late i am glad to see that you all got started without me now where is harvey where harvey dent the man of the hour where is rachel dawes she is my oldest friend come here when rachel first told me she was dating harvey dent i had one thing to say: the guy from those god awful campaign commercials i believe in harvey dent yeah nice slogan harvey but it caught rachel is attention and then i started to pay attention to harvey and all that he is been doing as our new da and you know what i believe in harvey dent i believe that on his watch gotham can feel a little safer a little more optimistic look at this face this is the face of gotham is bright future to harvey dent let is hear it for him harvey harvey may not know you well enough to understand you are making fun of him but i do no i meant every word you know that day that you once told me about when gotham would no longer need batman it is coming bruce you can not ask me to wait for that it is happening now harvey is that hero he locked up half of the city is criminals and he did it without wearing a mask gotham needs a hero with a face you can throw a party wayne i will give you that thanks again you mind if i borrow rachel lieutenant that joker card pinned to the body forensics found three sets of dna any matches all three the dna belongs to judge surrillo harvey dent and commissioner loeb the joker is telling us who he is targeting get a unit over to surrillo is house tell wuertz to find dent protective custody where is the commissioner city hall seal the building no one in or out till i get there got it gordon what are you up to we are secure i want a floor by floor search of the entire building we believe the joker is made a threat against your life these are dangerous people you are not giving me a lot of information even we do not know where you are going take the envelope get in open it it will tell you where you are headed you can not leave me alone with these people the whole mob is after you and you are worried about these guys compared to this the mob does not scare me gordon you are unlikely to discover this for yourself so take my word the police commissioner earns a lot of threats i found the appropriate response to these situations a long time ago them gunning for you makes you see things clearly yeah i bet yeah it makes you think about things you could not stand losing about who you wanna spend your life with that is a pretty big commitment not if the mob has their way you get to explain to my wife why i am late for dinner sir the joker card had traces of your dna on it do not do that all right let is be serious then okay what is your answer i do not have an answer how would they get my dna somebody with access to your office or house must have lifted a tissue or a glass wait wait well i guess no answer is a no harvey it is someone else is not it harvey just tell me it is not wayne the guy is a complete f what are

wanna see her smile again i just want her to know that i do not care about the scars so i stick a razor in my mouth and do this to myself and you know what she can not stand the sight of me she leaves now i see the funny side now i am always smiling you got a little fight in you i like that then you are gonna love me drop the gun oh sure you just take off your little mask and show us all who you really are hm let her go very poor choice of words are you all right let is not do that again is harvey okay he is safe thank you jim it is over as long as they do not get to lau we have cut off their funds the prosecution is over nobody is standing up in front of a judge while judges and police commissioners are getting blown away what about dent he is got any sense dent is halfway to mex so where do you keep your trash you are due in court i need you alive long enough to get you on the record you can not protect me you can not even protect yourselves you refuse to cooperate you are not coming back here you go to county how long do you calculate you will last in there targeting me will not get their money i knew the mob would not go down easily but this is different they crossed a line you crossed the line first you squeezed them you hammered them to the point of desperation and in their desperation they turned to a man they did not fully understand criminals are not complicated alfred we just need to figure out what he is after with respect master wayne perhaps this is a man you do not fully understand either a long time ago i was in burma and my friends and i were working for the local government they were trying to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders by bribing them with precious stones but their caravans were being raided in a forest north of rangoon by a bandit so we went looking for the stones but in six months we never met anyone who traded with him one day i saw a child playing with a ruby the size of a tangerine the bandit had been throwing them away so why steal them because he thought it was good sport because some men are not looking for anything logical like money they can not be bought bullied reasoned or negotiated with some men just wanna watch the world burn your name sir eighth and orchard you will find harvey dent there check the names richard dent patrick harvey harvey dent i need minutes with the scene before your men contaminate it it is because of you these guys are dead detective give us a minute guys that is brick underneath gonna take ballistics off a shattered bullet no fingerprints whatever you are gonna do do it fast because we

archives and i started pulling some old files do not tell me you did not recognize your baby pancaking cop cars on the evening news now you got the entire r&d department burning through cash claiming it is related to cell phones for the army what are you building for him now a rocket ship i want $ million a year for the rest of my life let me get this straight you think that your client one of the wealthiest most powerful men in the world is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands and your plan is to blackmail this person good luck when keep that this is your original scan here it is reengineered and there is the thumbprint he left when he pushed the round in the clip i will get you a copy mr wayne did you reassign r&d yeah government telecommunications project was not aware we had any government contracts you know lucius i am playing this one pretty close to the chest fair enough with no word from the batman even as they mourn commissioner loeb these cops have to wonder if the joker will make good on his threat in the obituary column of the gotham times to kill the mayor i have checked all the databases there are four possibles cross reference the addresses look for parkside overlooking the parade i got one melvin white randolph apartments aggravated assault moved to arkham twice what do you got on the roof we are tight but frankly there is a lot of windows up here commissioner loeb dedicated his life to law enforcement and to the protection of his community i remember when i first took office and i asked if he wanted to stay on as commissioner and he said he would provided i kept my politics out of his office clearly he was not a man who minced words nor should he have been a number of policies that he enacted as commissioner were unpopular policies that flooded my office with angry calls and letters who is that what happened they took our guns and our uniforms and as we recognize the sacrifice of this man we must remember that vigilance is the price of safety stand by honor guard attention port arms ready aim fire ready aim ready aim stay down do not move mr mayor get him out of here i will see you later why are you going back get out of here tell me what you know about the joker no i am sorry barbara jimmy go play with your sister go ahead honey if there is anything we can do anything you need we are here for you are you out there are you you brought this craziness on us you did you brought this on us switch it off he ai not coming he does not wanna talk to us god help whoever he does wanna talk to can not we go someplace quieter we can not hear each other talk what makes you think i wanna hear you talk what yeah second okay harvey where are you where are you i am where you should be at major crimes i am trying to deal with all of this mess can i get the fingerprint analysis rachel listen you are not safe there this is gordon is unit gordon is gone he vouched for these men and he is gone the joker is named you next god is there someone is there anyone in this town we can trust bruce we can trust bruce wayne no rachel i know you are his friend but harvey trust me bruce is penthouse is now the safest place in the city then you go straight there do not tell anybody and i will find you there i love you i want the joker from one professional to another you are trying to scare somebody pick a better spot from this height the fall would not kill me i am counting on it where is he i do not know where he is he found us he must have friends friends have you met this guy someone knows where he is nobody is gonna tell you nothing they are wise to your act you got rules the joker he is got no rules nobody is gonna cross him for you if you want this guy you got one way but you already know what that is just take off that mask let him come find you or you can let a couple more people get killed while you make up your mind you wanna play games how is that feel you would not i would not you do not think i will you do not think i will no no i would not that is why i am not gonna leave it up to me heads you get to keep your head tails not so lucky so you wanna tell me about the joker let is go again i do not know anything god do not you are not playing the odds friend let is do it again you would leave a man is life to chance not exactly his name is schiff thomas he is a paranoid schizophrenic former patient at arkham the kind of mind the joker attracts what do you expect to learn from him the joker killed gordon he is gonna kill rachel you are the symbol of hope i could never be your stand against organized crime is the first legitimate ray of light in gotham in decades if anyone saw this everything would be undone the criminals you arrested would be released and jim gordon will have died for nothing you are gonna hold a press conference tomorrow why no one else will die because of me gotham is in your hands now you can not you can not give in you can not give in harvey called he said batman is gonna turn himself in i have no choice you honestly think that is gonna keep the joker from killing people maybe not but i have enough blood on my hands and i have seen now what i would have to become to stop men like him you once told me that if the day came when i was finished that we would be together bruce do not make me your one hope for a normal life did you mean it yes bruce if you turn yourself in they are not gonna let us be together logs as well everything anything that could lead back to lucius or rachel people are dying alfred what would you have me do endure master wayne take it they will hate you for it but that is the point of batman he can be the outcast he can make the choice that no one else can make the right choice no today i found out what batman can not do he can not endure this today you get to say i told you so today i do not want to but i did bloody tell you i suppose they are gonna lock me up as well as your accomplice accomplice i am gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea ladies and gentlemen i have called this press conference for two reasons firstly to assure the citizens of gotham that everything that can be done over the joker killings is being done secondly because the batman has offered to turn himself in but let is consider the situation should we give in to this terrorist is demands do we really think he is gonna you would rather protect an outlaw vigilante than the lives of citizens the batman is an outlaw that is not why we demand he turn himself in we are doing it because we are scared we have been happy to let batman clean up our streets till now things are worse than ever amen yes they are but the night is darkest just before the dawn and i promise you the dawn is coming one day the batman will have to answer for the laws he is broken but to us not to this madman no more dead cops yeah he should turn himself in give us the batman come on where is he so be it take the batman into custody what is he here i am the batman what come on alfred why is he letting harvey do this he went down to the press conference i know he just stood by perhaps both bruce and mr dent believe that batman stands for something more important than the whims of a terrorist miss dawes even if everyone hates him for it that is the sacrifice he is making he is not being a hero he is being something more yeah you are absolutely right letting harvey take the fall for this is not heroic at all you know him better than anyone i do will you give this to him for me when the time is right how will i know it is not sealed goodbye alfred bye rachel i did not have time to talk this through what are you doing they are transferring me to central holding this is the joker is chance and when he attacks the batman will take him down listen this is too dangerous we get this guy to county he is their problem the streets will be cleared so let is go the convoys stop for no reason i hope you got some moves pal he is using you as bait he does not know if he can get the joker he is failed so far how do you know what he is thinking i just do anyway this is not just about you what about the people depending on you to clean the city up and do it honorably and harvey tell everyone the truth heads i go through with it this is your life you can not leave something like that to chance i am not you make your own luck hey you wait like everybody else pal what the hell is that obstruction ahead obstruction ahead damn it all units divert down onto lower fifth i repeat exit down exit down lower fifth we will be like turkeys on thanksgiving jesus come on get us out of here let is go listen we need backup we have got company we got trouble guys lock and load the hell was that

is the schemers that put you where you are you were a schemer you had plans and look where that got you police are taking every precaution urging people not to take matters into their hands i just did what i do best i took your little plan and i turned it on itself look what i did to this city with a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets you know what i noticed nobody panics when things go according to plan even if the plan is horrifying if tomorrow i tell the press that like a gangbanger will get shot or a truckload of soldiers will be blowing up nobody panics because it is all part of the plan but when i say that one little old mayor will die well then everyone loses their minds introduce a little anarchy upset the established order and everything becomes chaos i am an agent of chaos oh and you know the thing about chaos it is fair you live you die now we are talking mr reese that is mr wayne is not it that was a very brave thing you did trying to catch the light you were

evacuations i can not look but there was a victory inside this deliverance which should be noted our thankfulness at the escape of our army must not blind us to the fact that what has happened in france and belgium is a colossal military disaster we must expect another blow to be struck almost immediately we shall go on to the end we shall fight in france we shall fight on the seas and oceans we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air we shall defend our island whatever the cost what we shall defend our island whatever the cost may be we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the hills we shall never surrender and even if this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving then our empire beyond the seas armed and guarded by the british fleet would carry on the struggle until in god is good time the new world with all its power and might steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old\n"

farmers good farmers like you and tom uneducated farmers we are a caretaker generation coop and things are getting better maybe your grandkids will get to be engin are we done here sir no miss hanley is here to talk about murph murph is a great kid she is really bright but she is been having a little trouble lately she brought this in to show the students the section on the lunar landings yeah it is one of my old textbooks she always loved the pictures it is an old federal textbook we have replaced them with the corrected versions corrected explaining how the apollo missions were faked to bankrupt the soviet union you do not believe we went to the moon it was a brilliant piece of propaganda the soviets bankrupted themselves pouring resources into rockets and other useless machines useless machines if we do not want a repeat of the excess and wastefulness of the th century then we need to teach our kids about this planet not tales of leaving it one of those useless machines they used to make was called an mri if we had any of those left the doctors would have been able to find the cyst in my wife is brain before she died instead of afterwards then she would have been the one listening to this instead of me which would have been a good thing because she was always the calmer one i am sorry about your wife mr cooper but murph got into a fistfight with several of her classmates over this apollo nonsense so we thought it best to bring you in and see what ideas you might have for dealing with her behavior on the home front yeah you know what there is a game tomorrow night she is going through a bit of a baseball phase her favorite team is playing there is gonna be candy and soda and i think i will take her to that how would it go i got you suspended what cooper this is cooper go coop those combines you rebuilt went haywire just reset the controllers i did that now you should come take a look one by one they have been peeling off the fields and heading over something is interfering with the compass magnetism or some such nothing special about which book i have been working on it like you said i counted the spaces why in case the ghost is trying to communicate i am trying morse morse yeah dots and dashes used i know what morse code is murph i just do not think your bookshelf is trying to talk to you had to reset every compass clock and gps to offset for the anomaly which is i do not know if the house was built on magnetic ore we would have seen this the first time we switched on the tractor i hear your meeting at the school did not go so well you heard it is like we have forgotten who we are donald explorers pioneers not caretakers when i was a kid it felt like they made something new every day some gadget or idea like every day was christmas but six billion people just try to imagine that and every last one of them trying to have it all this world is not so bad and tom will do just fine you are the one who does not belong born years too late or years too early my daughter knew it god bless her and your kids know it especially murph well we used to look up in the sky and wonder at our place in the stars now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt cooper you were good at something and you never got a chance to do anything with it i am sorry you did not expect this dirt that was giving you this food to turn on you like that and destroy you in april i believe i am right fifteenth of april i think this happened about : when that thing came off the top of that canyon in my day we had real ballplayers who are these bums in my day people were too busy fighting over food to even play baseball popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural i want a hot dog school says you are gonna follow in my footsteps i think that is great you think that is great you hate farming dad grandpa said grandpa said listen all that matters is how you feel about it i like what you do i like our farm you are gonna be great at it let is get out of here all right it is a doozy all right gang let is mask up tom murph check yeah murph tom you guys shut your windows murph the ghost grab your pillow you are sleeping in with tom it is not a ghost it is gravity i am dropping tom then heading to town you want to clean that up when you have finished praying to it it is not morse murph it is binary thick is one thin is zero coordinates nope here we go thirty three that is it i can not miss this grandpa will be back in a couple hours murph but you do not know what you are gonna find and that is why i can not take you murph grandpa will be home in a while tell him i will call him on the radio jesus what are you doing you think this is funny you would not be here if it was not for me make yourself useful hey murph murph i think this is the end of the road did not you bring the bolt cutters that is my girl step away do not shoot i am not armed my daughter is in the car do not be afraid how did you find this place where is my daughter you had the coordinates for this facility marked on your map where did you get them where is my daughter do not make me take you down again sit down you still think you are a marine pal marines do not exist anymore and i got grunts like you mowing my grass where did you find those coordinates but you do not look much like a lawnmower think i will turn you into an overqualified vacuum cleaner no you will not tars back down please you know you are taking a risk using ex military security they are old and their control units are unpredictable it is what the government could spare who are you dr brand i knew a dr brand once he was a professor what makes you think i am not was not near as cute either please dr brand i do not have any idea what this is now i am scared for my daughter and want her by my side you give me that i will tell you anything you want to know get the principals and the girl in the conference room please your daughter is fine bright kid must have a very smart mother it is pretty clear you do not want any visitors so why do not you just let us back up from your fence and we will be on our way it is not that simple well sure it is i do not know anything about you i do not know anything about this place yes you do dad hello cooper professor brand explain to me how you found this facility kind of an accident we sort of stumbled upon it we were on a salvage run you are sitting in the best kept secret in the world nobody stumbles in here nobody stumbles out cooper please cooperate with these people look it is kind of hard to explain we learned these coordinates from an anomaly what sort of anomaly i hesitate to term it supernatural but it definitely was not scientific you are going to have to be specific mr cooper right now it was gravity what sort of gravitational anomaly where was this now i am real happy that you are excited about gravity bud but you are not getting any answers from us until i get assurances assurances yeah like that we are getting out of here and i do not mean in the trunk of some car do not you know who we are coop no professor i do not you know my father professor brand we are nasa nasa nasa the same nasa you flew for i heard they shut you down sir for refusing to drop bombs from the stratosphere onto starving people when they realized that killing other people was not a long term solution then they needed us back in secret why secret because public opinion would not allow spending on space exploration not while you are struggling to put food on the table blight wheat seven years ago okra this year now there is just corn and we are growing more than we ever have but like the potatoes in ireland and the wheat in the dust bowl the corn will die soon we will find a way professor we always have driven by the unshakable faith the earth is ours not just ours no but it is our home earth is atmosphere is percent nitrogen we do not even breathe nitrogen blight does and as it thrives our air gets less and less oxygen the last people to starve will be the first to suffocate and your daughter is generation will be the last to survive on earth murph is tired i was wondering if she could take a nap in my office yeah thank you okay now you need to tell me what your plan is to save the world we are not meant to save the world we are meant to leave it rangers the last components of our one versatile ship in orbit the endurance our final expedition you sent people out there looking for a new home the lazarus missions that sounds cheerful lazarus came back from the dead sure but he had to die in the first place there is not a planet in our solar system that could sustain life and the nearest star is over a thousand years away that does not even qualify as futile where would you send them cooper i can not tell you anymore unless you agree to pilot this craft you are the best pilot we ever had i barely left the stratosphere this team never left the simulator we need a pilot and this is the mission that you were trained for without even knowing it an hour ago you did not even know i was alive you were going anyway we had no choice but something sent you here they chose you who is they how long would i be gone hard to know years i have got kids professor get out there and save them who is they we started detecting gravitational anomalies almost years ago mostly small distortions to our instruments in the upper atmosphere in fact i believe you encountered one yourself yeah over the straights my crash something tripped my fly by wire exactly but of all these anomalies the most significant is this: out near saturn a disturbance of space time is that a wormhole it appeared years ago and it leads where another galaxy a wormhole is not a naturally occurring phenomenon someone placed it there they and whoever they are they appear to be looking out for us that wormhole lets us travel to other stars it came along right as we needed it they have put potentially habitable worlds right within our reach twelve in fact from our initial probes you sent probes into that we sent people into it ten years ago the lazarus missions twelve possible worlds twelve ranger launches carrying the bravest humans ever to live led by the remarkable dr mann each person is landing pod had enough life support for two years but they could use hibernation to stretch that making observations on organics over a decade or more their mission was to assess their world and if it showed potential then they could send out a signal bed down for the long nap wait to be rescued and what if the world did not show promise hence the bravery you do not have the resources to visit all no data transmission back through the wormhole is rudimentary simple binary pings on an annual basis give us some clue as to which worlds have potential and one system shows promise one that is a bit of a long shot is not it one system with three potential worlds no long shot okay so if we find a home then what that is the long shot there is a plan a and a plan b did you notice anything strange about the launch chamber this entire facility is a centrifuge some kind of vehicle a space station both plan a how do you get it off the ground the first gravitational anomalies changed everything suddenly we knew that harnessing gravity was real so i started working on a theory and we started building this station but you have not solved it yet that is why there is plan b the problem is gravity how to get a viable amount of human life off the planet this is one way plan b: a population bomb over fertilized eggs weighing in at just under kilos how would you raise them with equipment on board we incubate the first after that with surrogacy the growth becomes exponential within years we could have a colony of hundreds the real difficulty with colonization is genetic diversity this takes care of that but what about the people here you just give up on them my kids that is why plan a is a lot more fun how far have you got almost there you are asking me to hang everything on an almost i am asking you to trust me find us a new home and by the time you return i will have solved the problem of gravity i give you my word go away murph go if you are leaving just go this world was never enough for you was it coop what because heading out there is what i feel like i was born to do and it excites me no that does not make it wrong it might do not trust the right thing done for the wrong reason the why of the thing that is the foundation and the foundation is solid we farmers we sit here every year when the rains fail and we say: next year well next year ai not gonna save us nor the one after that this world is a treasure donald but it is been telling us to leave for a while now mankind was born on earth it was never meant to die here tom will be all right but you got to make things right with murph i will without making promises you do not know you can keep you have to talk to me murph i need to fix this before i go then i will keep it broken so you have to stay after you kids came along your mom said something to me i never quite understood she said now we are just here to be memories for our kids and i think that now i understand what she meant once you are a parent you are the ghost of your children is future you said ghosts did not exist that is right murph murph look at me i can not be your ghost right now i need to exist they chose me murph they chose me you saw you are the one who led me to them that is exactly why you can not go i figured out the message one word know what it is murph stay it says stay dad murph you do not believe me look at the books look at this it says stay why you are not listening it says stay no i am coming back when one for you one for me when i am up there in hypersleep or traveling near the speed of light or near a black hole time is gonna change for me it is gonna run more slowly when we get back we are gonna compare time will run differently for us yeah by the time i get back we might even be the same age you and me what imagine that aw murph you have no idea when you are coming back no idea at all murph do not do not make me leave like this come on murph do not make me leave like this murph hey i love you forever you hear me i love you forever and i am coming back i am coming back how would it go fine just fine i love you tom travel safe yeah you look after our place for me all right all right hey can i use your truck while you are gone you mean your truck i will make sure they bring it back look after my kids donald go for main engine start t minus dad nine dad eight seven dad six five main engine start four three two one booster ignition and all engines look good beginning roll program prepare for stage one separation stage one there is mach everybody good plenty of slaves for my robot colony they gave him a humor setting so he would fit in better with his unit he thinks it relaxes us a giant sarcastic robot what a great idea i have a cue light i can use when i am joking if you like that would probably help you can use it to find your way back to the ship after i blow you out the airlock what is your humor setting tars that is percent let is bring it on down to please stage two separation all feeds going manual going manual deactivate probe heater one two and three check taking control this is handover to you a d f check over pull thrusters back fuel cells one two three one hundred percent ex mites it is hard leaving everything my kids your father we are going to be spending a lot of time together we should learn to talk and when not to just being honest i do not think you need to be that honest hey tars what is your honesty parameter ninety percent ninety percent absolute honesty is not always the most diplomatic nor the safest form of communication with emotional beings okay ninety percent it is dr brand we are coming up on the endurance twelve minutes out okay taking control approaching module port meters it is all you doyle nice and easy doyle nice and easy i feel good take us home lock target locked well done okay helmets on good job door is not charging never mind cooper you should have control control here communication with ring module active that is initiate are we ready to spin just a sec hello case hello tars all right we are all set all right let is do it thirty percent of spin one g how is gravity treating you back there well romilly hey you okay yeah you all right yeah i just need a minute we have some dramamine in the hab pod or maybe in the cryo beds i will just be a sec hey brand yeah bring a lot amelia be safe give my regards to dr mann i will dad it looks good for your trajectory we have calculated two years to saturn that is a lot of dramamine look after my family will you please sir we will be waiting for you when you get back a little older a little wiser but happy to see you do not go gentle into that good night old age should burn and rave at close of day rage rage against the dying of the light though wise men at their end know dark is right because their words had forked no lightning they do not go gentle into that good night rage rage against the dying of the light you good yeah okay thank you here pills so alone we have each other dr mann had it worse no i mean them it is a perfect planet and we will not find another one like her no it is not like looking for a new condo the human race is going to be adrift desperate for a rock it can cling to while it catches its breath we need to find that rock and our three prospects are at the edge of what might sustain human life laura miller is planet is first laura started our biology program wolf edmunds is here tell me about edmunds wolf is a particle physicist none of them had families no no attachments my father insisted they all knew the odds against ever seeing another human being again i am hoping we can surprise at least three of them how about mann dr mann he is remarkable he is the best of us he inspired people to follow him on the loneliest journey in human history scientists explorers that is what i love you know out there we face great odds death but not evil you do not think nature can be evil no formidable frightening but no not evil is a lion evil because it rips a gazelle to shreds just what we take with us then yeah this crew represents the best of humanity even me you know what we agreed percent there you go do not stay up i will be there in a minute just remember coop you are literally wasting your breath hey tars let is go over that trajectory one more time eight months to mars counter orbital slingshot around fourteen months to saturn nothing is changed on that just let me ask you something dr brand and edmunds why are you whispering they can not hear you dr brand and edmunds they close i would not know is that percent would not know or percent would not know i also have a discretion setting cooper but not a poker face slick hey guys dad is about to go down for the long nap so i wanted to give you an update the earth looks amazing from here you can not see any of the dust i really hope you guys are doing great i know you will get this message professor brand is assured me he will get it to you know that i love you is it him i do not think so murph you must be donald hello murph why are you in my dad is truck he wanted me to bring it for your brother he sent you a message she is pretty upset with him for leaving if you record any messages i can get them to transmit it to cooper murph is a bright spark maybe i should fan the flame she is already making fools of her teachers so maybe she should come and make a fool out of you so where are they heading for mars the next time you hear from cooper they will be coming up on saturn as far as school goes the administration wants me to repeat plant pathology which sucks but they said i could start advanced agriculture a year early all right i got to go dad hope you are safe up there sorry coop i asked murph to say hi but she is as stubborn as her old man i will try again next time you all right rom this gets to me cooper this this millimeters of aluminum that is it and then nothing out there for millions of miles will not kill us in seconds you know that some of the finest solo yachtsmen in the world do not know how to swim they do not know how and if they go overboard they are done we are explorers rom this is our boat here this is from the relay probe it was in orbit around the wormhole this is the wormhole and every time we would come around we would receive images from the other side of the foreign galaxy yeah like swinging a periscope around exactly so we got a pretty good idea what we are gonna find on the other side navigationally guys we will be approaching the wormhole in about three hours hey coop can we stop the spinning why because we are close enough to see it now all right thanks there that is it that is the wormhole say it do not spray it rom it is a sphere of course it is what you you thought it would just be a hole no it is just that all the illustrations i have ever seen they in the illustrations they are trying to show you how it works so they say you want to go from here to there but it is too far right so a wormhole bends space like this so you can take a shortcut through a higher dimension okay so to show that they have turned three dimensional space into two dimensions which turns a wormhole into two dimensions a circle what is a circle in three dimensions a sphere exactly a spherical hole but who put it there who do we have to thank i am not thanking anybody until we get out of here in one piece rom any trick to this doyle no one knows the others made it right at least some of them everybody ready to say goodbye to our solar system to our galaxy here we go the controls will not work here we are passing through the bulk it is space beyond our three dimensions all you can do is record and observe what is that i think it is them distorting space time do not do not what was that the first handshake we are we are here so the lost communications came through how the relay on this side cached them so years of basic data no real surprises miller is site has kept pinging thumbs up as has dr mann is edmunds' went down three years ago transmitter failure maybe he was sending the thumbs up right until it went dark but miller is still looks good though right because she is coming up fast with one complication the planet is much closer to gargantua than we thought gargantua it is what we are calling the black hole miller is and dr mann is planets both orbit it and miller is is on the horizon as a basketball around a hoop landing there takes us dangerously close and a black hole that big has a huge gravitational pull look i could swing around that neutron star to decelerate no it is not that it is time the gravity on that planet will slow our clock compared to earth is drastically how bad every hour we spend on that planet will be seven years back on earth jesus well that is relativity folks well we can not just drop down there without cooper we have a mission yeah doyle we have a mission and our mission plan a is to find a planet that can habitate the people that are living on earth now you can not just think about your family now you have to think bigger i am thinking about my family and millions of other families okay plan a does not work if the people on earth are dead by the time we pull it off no it does not that is why there is a plan b okay cooper is right we need to think of time as a resource like oxygen and food going down will cost us all right look dr mann is data is promising but it will take months to get there and edmunds' it is even further miller has not sent much but what she has is very promising it is water it is organics you do not find that every day no you do not and just think about the resources including time that would be spent trying to get back here romilly yeah how far off from miller is planet do we have to be to stay out of the time shift just back from the cusp all right which is here just outside of miller is planet right okay here is gargantua here is miller is planet instead of taking the endurance into orbit around miller is planet which would conserve fuel but we would lose a lot of time what if we take a wider orbit around gargantua parallel with miller is planet outside of this time shift to here then we take the ranger down we get miller we get her samples we come back we analyze we debrief we are in we are out we lose a little fuel but we save a whole lot of time that will work that is good there is no time for monkey business or chit chat down there so tars you should definitely stay here case you are with me anyone else can stay if we are talking about a couple years i could use the time to research gravity observations from the wormhole that is gold to professor brand tars factor an orbit of gargantua conserve fuel minimize thrusting but make sure we stay in range of miller is planet you got it i would not leave you behind dr brand you ready case yup you do not say much do you tars talks plenty for both of us detach romilly are you reading these forces it is unbelievable a literal heart of darkness if we could just see the collapsed star inside the singularity yeah we would solve gravity and we can not get anything from it nothing escapes that horizon not even light the answer is there just no way to see it there is miller is planet goodbye ranger this is fast for atmospheric entry should we use the thrusters to slow no i am gonna use the ranger is aerodynamics to save some fuel air brake we want to get down fast do not we we want to get there in one piece hang on brand doyle get ready we should ease hands where i can see them the only time i went down was when a machine was easing at the wrong time a little caution can get you killed like reckless driving cooper it is too damn fast i got this should i disable the feedback no i need to feel the air here we go it is just water the stuff of life twelve hundred meters do we have a fix on the beacon got it can you maneuver i will need to shave some speed i am gonna spiral down on top of it everybody hang on seven hundred on my cue case on my cue five hundred meters fire very graceful no but very efficient what are you waiting for let is go go go go seven years per hour here let is make it count this way about meters the gravity is punishing been floating through space too long one hundred and thirty percent earth gravity come on come on there is nothing here should be right here if the signal is coming from here then her beacon wreckage where is the rest towards the mountains those are not mountains they are waves oh shit oh shit oh shit that one is moving away from us we need the recorder brand doyle back to the ranger now we are not leaving without her data get back here now we do not have time the second wave is coming we are in the middle of a swell no i got it get your ass back to the ranger now brand get back here now no cooper go cooper go i can not make it go case go get her go get up get up brand go go go i am not gonna make it yes you are yes you are come on case has her get back here doyle come on get to the hatch go go go shit manually overriding inside hatch cooper wait the engines are flooded i am gonna have to shut her down holy shit hang on case what is the problem too waterlogged let it drain goddamn it i told you to leave me why did not you and i told you to get your ass back here one of us was thinking about the mission you were thinking about getting home i was trying to do the right thing can you tell that to doyle case how much time forty five to an hour the stuff of life what is this gonna cost us brand a lot decades what happened to miller judging by the wreckage she was broken up by a wave soon after impact how is the wreckage stayed together after all these years because of the time slippage on this planet is time she just landed hours ago she probably just died minutes ago the data doyle received was just the initial status echoing endlessly we are not prepared for this you eggheads have the survival skills of a boy scout troop well we got this far on our brains farther than any human in history well not far enough and now we are stuck here till there will not be anyone left on earth to save i am counting every minute same as you cooper is there any possibility some kind of a way we can maybe all jump in a black hole gain back the years do not shake your head at me time is relative okay it can stretch and it can squeeze but it can not run backwards it just can not the only thing that can move across dimensions like time is gravity okay the beings that led us here they communicate through gravity right yes could they be talking to us from the future maybe okay if they can they are beings of five dimensions to them time might be another physical dimension to them the past might be a canyon that they can climb into and the future a mountain they can climb up but to us it is not okay look cooper i screwed up i am sorry but you knew about relativity brand my daughter was years old i could not teach her einstein is theories before i left could not you have told her you were going to save the world no when you become a parent one thing becomes really clear and that is that you want to make sure your children feel safe and it rules out telling a year old that the world is ending cooper how long for the engines case a minute or two we do not have it helmets on brand co pilot you are up case blow the cabin oxygen through the main thrusters we are gonna spark it roger that locked depressurizing engines up hello rom i have waited years how how many years by now it must be twenty three years four months eight days doyle i thought i was prepared i knew the theory reality is different and miller there is nothing here for us why did not you sleep i had a couple of stretches but i stopped believing you were coming back and something seemed wrong about dreaming my life away i learned what i could from the black hole but i could not send anything to your father we have been receiving but nothing gets out is he alive yeah yeah yeah we have got years of messages stored cooper messages span years play it from the beginning hey dad checking in saying hi finished second in school miss kurling is still giving me c is though pulled me down but second is not bad grandpa attended the ceremony i met another girl dad i i really think this is the one name is lois that is her right there murphy stole grandpa is car she crashed it she is okay though hey dad look at this you are a grandpa his name is jesse i kind of wanted to call him coop but lois says maybe next time donald says he is already earned the great part so we just leave it at that oh dear oh dear say bye bye grandpa bye bye grandpa okay sorry it is been a while just what with jesse and all grandpa died last week we buried him out in the back forty next to mom and jesse which is where we would have buried you if you would ever come back murph was there at the funeral we do not see her that much but she came for that you are not listening to this i know that all these messages are just like drifting out there in the darkness lois says that i have to let you go and so i guess i am letting you go i do not know where you are dad but i hope that you are at peace goodbye hey dad hey murph you son of a bitch i never made one of these when you were still responding because i was so mad at you for leaving and then when you went quiet it seemed like i should live with that decision and i have but today is my birthday and it is a special one because you told me you once told me that when you came back we might be the same age and today i am the age you were when you left so it would be a real good time for you to come back i did not mean to intrude it is just that i have never seen you in here before i have never been in here before i talk to amelia all the time it helps i am glad you have started i have not i i just had something i needed to get out i know they are still out there i know there are so many reasons their communications might not be getting through i know professor i am not sure what i am more afraid of them never coming back or coming back to find we have failed then let is succeed so back to the fourth iteration let is run it through some new fields with respect professor we have tried that hundreds of times it only has to work once murph every rivet that they strike could have been a bullet we have done well for the world here whether or not we crack the equation before i kick the bucket do not be morbid professor i am not afraid of death i am an old physicist i am afraid of time time you are afraid of time we have been trying to solve the equation without changing the underlying assumption about time and and that means each iteration is an attempt to prove its own proof it is recursive it is nonsensical are you calling my life is work nonsense murph no i am saying that you have been trying to finish it with one arm no with both arms tied behind your back and i do not understand why i am an old man murph can we take this point up at another time i want to talk to my daughter stepping out into the universe we must confront the reality of interstellar travel we must reach far beyond our own lifespans we must think not as individuals but as a species do not go gentle into that good night tars kept the endurance right where we needed her but the trip took years longer than we anticipated we no longer have the fuel to visit both prospects so we have to choose but how they are both promising edmunds' data is better but dr mann is the one still transmitting so we have no reason to suspect edmunds is data would have soured his world has key elements to sustain human life as does dr mann is cooper this is my field and i really believe edmunds' is the better prospect why gargantua that is why look at miller is planet hydrocarbons organics yes but no life sterile we will find the same thing on mann is because of the black hole murphy is law whatever can happen will happen accident is the first building block of evolution but when you are orbiting a black hole not enough can happen it sucks in asteroids and comets other events which would otherwise reach you we need to go further afield you once said that dr mann was the best of us he is remarkable we are only here because of him and yet yet here he is he is on the ground and he is sending a very unambiguous message telling us to come to his planet granted but edmunds' data is more promising we should vote well if we vote there is something you should know brand he has a right to know that has nothing to do with it what does she is in love with wolf edmunds is that true yes and that makes me want to follow my heart but maybe we have spent too long trying to figure all this out with theory you are a scientist brand so listen to me when i say that love is not something we invented it is observable powerful it has to mean something love has meaning yes social utility social bonding child rearing we love people who have died where is the social utility in that none maybe it means something more something we can not yet understand maybe it is some evidence some artifact of a higher dimension that we can not consciously perceive i am drawn across the universe to someone i have not seen in a decade who i know is probably dead love is the one thing we are capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space maybe we should trust that even if we can not understand it yet all right cooper yes the tiniest possibility of seeing wolf again excites me that does not mean i am wrong honestly amelia it might tars chart a course for dr mann is we will lose about a third again but next year next year i am gonna work nelson is farm and we will make it up what happened to nelson murph would you like some more soufflã© oh no i am full thanks it was delicious coop finish your fritter please will you spend the night your room is exactly as you left it it is ready i need to get back my sewing machine is in there but there is plenty i need to too many memories we might have something for that hey coop the dust lois i have a friend who could look at his lungs amelia i am sorry you were just being objective unless you are punishing me for screwing up on miller is planet no this was not a personal decision if you are wrong you will have a very personal decision to make your fuel calculations are based on a return journey strike out on mann is planet and we will have to decide whether to return home or push on to edmunds' with plan b starting a colony could save us from extinction you might have to decide between seeing your children again and the future of the human race i trust you will be as objective then he is been asking for you since he came to we were trying to reach you murph i am here professor i let you all down no you got us so far real close i will finish what you started good good murph you had faith all those all those years i i asked you to have faith i wanted you to believe that your father would come back i do professor forgive me murph there is nothing to forgive i i lied murph i lied to you there was no need for him to to come back there is no way to help us but plan a all this all these people and the equation did my father know did he leave me do not go gentle no no you can not leave you no dr brand i am sorry to tell you that your father died today he had no pain he was at peace i am very sorry for your loss brand did you know he told you right you knew this was all a sham you left us here to suffocate to starve frozen cloud it is okay it is okay it is okay pray you never learn just how good it can be to see another face i had not a lot of hope to begin with but after so long i had none my supplies were completely exhausted the last time i went to sleep i did not even set a waking date you have literally raised me from the dead lazarus what about the others i am afraid you are it sir so far surely no our present situation is that there is very little chance of rescuing any others dr mann dr mann tell us about your world our world we hope our world is cold stark but undeniably beautiful the days are hours long cold the nights are far colder hours the gravity is a very very pleasant percent of the earth is now up here where i landed the water is alkali and the air has too much ammonia to breathe for more than just a few minutes but down at the surface and there is a surface the chlorine dissipates the ammonia gives way to crystalline hydrocarbons and breathable air to organics possibly even to life we might be sharing this world these readings are from the surface over the years i have dropped various probes how far have you explored i have mounted several major expeditions but with oxygen in limited supply kipp there really did most of the legwork what went wrong with him sir degeneration he misidentified the first organics we found as ammonia crystals we struggled on for a time but ultimately i decommissioned him and used his power source to keep the mission going i thought i was alone before i shut him down would you like me to look at him no no he needs a human touch dr brand case is relaying a message for you from the comm station okay be right there excuse me dr brand i am sorry to tell you that your father died today he had no pain he was at peace i am sorry for your loss is that murph she is she is grown brand did you know he told you right you knew this was all a sham you left us here to suffocate to starve did my father know too dad i just want to know if you left me here to die i just have to know cooper my my father dedicated his whole life to plan a i have no idea what she is talking about i do he never even hoped to get the people off the earth no but he is been trying to solve the gravity equation for years amelia your father solved his equation before i even left then why would not he use it the equation could not reconcile relativity with quantum mechanics you need more more more what more data you need to see into a black hole the laws of nature prohibit a naked singularity romilly is that true if a black hole is an oyster then the singularity is the pearl inside the gravity is so strong it is always hidden in darkness behind the horizon that is why we call it a black hole okay but if we see beyond the horizon we can not coop there are some things that are not meant to be known your father had to find another way to save the human race from extinction plan b a colony why not tell people why keep building those stations he knew how hard it would be to get people to work together to save the species instead of themselves or their children bullshit you never would have come unless you believed you would save them evolution has yet to transcend that simple barrier we can care deeply selflessly about those we know but that empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight but the lie that monstrous lie unforgivable and he knew that he was prepared to destroy his own humanity in order to save the species he made an incredible sacrifice no an incredible sacrifice is being made by the people on earth who are gonna die because in his fucking arrogance he declared their case hopeless i am sorry cooper their case is hopeless no no we are the future cooper what can i do let me go home you are absolutely positive his solution was correct he would had it for years it is worthless it is half the answer okay how do you find the other half out there a black hole but stuck down here on earth yeah i am not sure you can god they just pack up and leave what are they hoping to find survival damn it murph do not do not people have a right to know panic will not help we just have to keep working same as ever but is not that exactly what professor brand was manipulating us to do brand gave up on us i am still trying to solve this so do you have an idea a feeling i told you about my ghost my dad thought i called it a ghost because i was scared of it but i was never scared of it i called it a ghost because it felt it felt like a person it was trying to tell me something if there is an answer here on earth it is back there somehow in that room so i have to find it we are running out of time what about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers no they can stay i will be sleeping anyway hey coop yeah i have a suggestion for your return journey yeah what is that have one last crack at the black hole i am going home rom yeah i know this is not going to cost you any time there is a chance for the people on earth talk to me gargantua is an older spinning black hole it is what we call a gentle singularity gentle they are hardly gentle but the tidal gravity is so quick that something crossing the horizon fast might survive a probe say what happens after it crosses after the horizon is a complete mystery so what is to say there is not some way that the probe can glimpse the singularity and relay the quantum data if he is equipped to transmit every form of energy that can pulse just when did this probe become a he professor tars is the obvious candidate i have already told him what to look for i would need the old optical transmitter off kipp cooper you would do this for us before you get all teary remember that as a robot i have to do anything you say your cue light is broken i am not joking i will need tars to remove and adapt some components from kipp i do not want to disturb his archival functions i will supervise all right dr mann we need to find three secure sites one for brand is lab two for habitat once those modules have landed you do not want to move them i can take you to the probe sites but i do not think these conditions will hold i think we should wait case is headed down with the rest of the distillery equipment i would really like to secure those sites by nightfall well these squalls do usually blow over okay then you will need a long range transmitter got it are you charged yeah follow me tars hours yeah roger that cooper brand told me why you feel you have to go back but i would be remiss if i did not at least mention that a mission such as ours could certainly use an extra engineer you better slow down turbo safety first case remember safety first cooper i have to tell you dr mann i am honored to be a part of this but once we set up base camp and secure those modules my work is done here i am going home you have attachments but even without a family i can promise you that that yearning to be with other people is powerful that emotion is at the foundation of what makes us human it is not to be taken lightly how long have you had that cough a while mom lets me play in here i do not touch your stuff just take this gently you know why we could not just send machines on these missions do not you a machine does not improvise well because you can not program a fear of death our survival instinct is our single greatest source of inspiration take you for example a father with a survival instinct that extends to your kids what does research tell us is the last thing you are going to see before you die your children their faces at the moment of death your mind is gonna push a little bit harder to survive for them deep breath hey i bet you are coop why do not you have a seat here for me it is bad they cannot stay here okay yeah tars what is taking so long professor i am having trouble completing the boot up i do not understand it is funny when i left earth i thought i was prepared to die the truth is i never really considered the possibility that my planet was not the one nothing worked out the way it was supposed to let is go all right buddy give me a big deep breath what is this what are you doing i am sorry i can not let you leave with that ship we are gonna need it to complete the mission once the others realize what this place is not we cannot survive here i am sorry i am sorry they can not stay here anymore you have to leave right now let me make something abundantly clear you have a responsibility jesus coop get her stuff she is going home dad did not raise you to be this dumb tom dad did not raise me grandpa did and he is buried out back with mom and jesse you faked all the data yeah there is no surface no i tried to do my duty cooper but i knew the day that i arrived here that this place had nothing and i resisted the temptation for years but i knew that if i just pressed that button then somebody would come and save me you fucking coward yes yes yes yes listen if you are not going to go let your family go just save your family and we go live underground with you pray that daddy comes to save us dad is not coming back he never was coming back it is up to me you are gonna save everybody because dad could not do it dad did not even try dad just abandoned us he left us here to die nobody is going with you you gonna wait for your next kid to die get out and do not come back you can keep my stuff stop it no no dr mann there is a chance you are gonna kill yourself those are the best odds i have had in years do not judge me cooper you were never tested like i was few men have been you tried your best murph you are feeling it are not you the survival instinct that is what drove me it is what drives all of us and it is what is gonna save us because i want to save all of us for you cooper i am sorry i can not watch you go through this i am sorry i thought i could but i can not i am here i am here for you just listen to my voice cooper i am right here you are not alone do you see your children it is okay they are right there with you did professor brand tell you that poem before you left do you remember do not go gentle into that good night old age should burn and rave at close of day rage rage against the dying of the light brand help help cooper case no air ammonia cooper cooper we are coming case i have a fix go go go go and away cooper we are coming hang in there do not talk try to breathe as little as possible we are almost there there is a security lockout sir it requires a person to access function it is all yours sir try not to breathe we are coming we are coming right now case come on come on we got to go faster case faster faster faster hang in there come on i see him i see him case bank bank right cooper cooper i am here this data makes no sense i am sorry what mann was lying go go romilly romilly romilly do you read me romilly step back professor step back romilly romilly do you read me keep watch lois what happened to caution case safety first cooper romilly romilly do you read me this is brand romilly dr brand cooper there is been an explosion dr mann is compound tars tars o'clock let me know when tars is aboard romilly did not survive i could not save him tars is in i will take her now do we have a fix on the ranger he is pushing into orbit if he takes control of that ship we are dead he would maroon us he is marooning us i will meet you guys downstairs go wait by the car come on give me your bag get in the backseat get in the backseat now dr mann please respond dr mann please respond he does not know the endurance docking procedure the autopilot does not since tars disabled it nice what is your trust setting tars lower than yours apparently do not attempt docking i repeat do not attempt docking please res auto docking sequence withheld override unauthorized override unauthorized do not attempt docking i repeat do not attempt docking please resp moving slowly toward the endurance imperfect contact override hatch lockout is he locked on yet imperfectly dr mann do not hatch lockout disengaged dr mann do not i repeat do not open the hatch i repeat do not open the hatch if you open the hatch the airlock will depressurize what happens if he blows the airlock nothing good okay pull back retro thrusters everything we have got case thrusters are full back relay my transmission to the on board computer and have it rebroadcast as emergency p a dr mann i repeat do not open the inner hatch i repeat brand i do not know what he said to you but i am taking command of the endurance and then we can talk about completing the mission dr mann listen to me this is not about my life or cooper is life this is about all mankind there is a moment it is not sa oh my god there is no point using fuel to chase analyze the endurance is spin cooper what are you doing docking endurance rotation is rpm okay get ready to match our spin with the retro thrusters it is not possible no it is necessary endurance is hitting stratosphere she is got no heat shield case you ready ready cooper this is no time for caution case if i black out you take the stick tars get ready to engage the docking mechanism endurance is starting to heat twenty feet out i need three degrees starboard cooper ten feet out cooper we are lined up initiating spin come on tars come on tars we are locked cooper locked easing up easy easy retro thrusters main engines on pushing out of orbit come on baby killing main engines okay we are out of orbit okay and for our next trick it will have to be good we are heading into gargantua is pull oh shit case take the stick roger that cooper we are slipping towards gargantua shall i use main engines no we got to let her slide as far as we can give it to me there is good news there is bad news yeah i have heard that one tars give it to me straight the backup generator kicked in so the system is stable they are all good good okay the navigational hub has been completely destroyed we do not have enough life support to make it back to earth but we can scratch our way to edmunds' planet what about fuel not enough but i have a plan we let gargantua pull us down close to her horizon then a powered slingshot around launching us towards edmunds' planet manually that is what i am here for i am gonna take us just inside the critical orbit what about time slippage neither of us has time to worry about relativity right now dr brand i am sorry cooper once we have gathered enough speed around gargantua we use lander and ranger as rocket boosters to push us out of the black hole is gravity the lander is linkages have been destroyed so we will have to control manually once lander is spent tars will detach and get sucked into that black hole why does tars have to detach we have to shed the weight to escape the gravity newton is third law the only way humans have ever figured out of getting somewhere is to leave something behind cooper you can not ask tars to do this for us he is a robot so you do not have to ask him to do anything cooper you asshole sorry you broke up a little bit there it is what we intended dr brand it is our only chance to save people on earth if i can find a way to transmit the quantum data i will find in there they might still make it let is just hope there is still someone there to save maximum velocity achieved prepare to fire escape thrusters ready ready ready main engine ignition in three two one mark come on baby lander engines on my mark three two one mark ranger engines on my mark three two one mark fire this little maneuver is gonna cost us years you do not sound so bad for pushing lander prepare to detach on my mark three two one mark detach goodbye tars goodbye dr brand see you on the other side coop see you there slick okay case nice reckless flying learned from the master ranger prepare to detach what no no cooper what are you doing newton is third law you got to leave something behind you told me we had enough resources for both of us we agreed amelia percent do not detach okay i am nosing down approaching the event horizon portside dipping down beneath it to go through it heading towards blackness i have a visual of the event it is all black tars do you read me it is all blackness tars do you read me over okay screens getting interference losing control of the stick i got flashes flashes of lightness and blackness the turbulence in the gravity is increasing the computers are going down gravitational pull i am losing control of the stick murph murph come on eject eject eject eject eject eject murph murph murph murph murph no no no murph murph no no if you are leaving just go no no no no do not go do not go you idiot do not go morse morse morse dot dot s t a dash dash dash murph murph we do not have time for this come on y stay come on come on murph come on what is it say what is it say murph what is it say stay tell him murph make him stay make him stay murph make him stay murph do not let me leave murph do not let me leave murph no no no it was you you were my ghost cooper cooper come in cooper tars roger that you survived somewhere in their fifth dimension they saved us yeah who the hell is they and just why would they want to help us i do not know but they constructed this three dimensional space inside their five dimensional reality to allow you to understand it yeah that ai not working yes it is you have seen that time is represented here as a physical dimension you have worked out that you can exert a force across space time gravity to send a message affirmative gravity can cross the dimensions including time apparently do you have the quantum data roger i have it i am transmitting it on all wavelengths but nothing is getting out cooper i can do this i can do this but such complicated data to a child not just any child what else come on dad murph the fire is out come on even if you communicate it here she will not understand its significance for years i get that tars but we have got to figure something out or the people on earth are gonna die think cooper they did not bring us here to change the past say that again they did not bring us here to change the past no they did not bring us here at all we brought ourselves tars give me the coordinates for nasa in binary in binary roger feeding data it is not a ghost it is gravity do not you get it yet tars i brought myself here we are here to communicate with the three dimensional world we are the bridge i thought they chose me but they did not choose me they chose her for what cooper to save the world all of this is one little girl is bedroom every moment it is infinitely complex they have access to infinite time and space but they are not bound by anything they can not find a specific place in time they can not communicate that is why i am here i am gonna find a way to tell murph just like i found this moment how cooper love tars love it is just like brand said my connection with murph it is quantifiable it is the key what are we here to do find how to tell her the watch the watch that is it we code the data into the movement of the second hand tars translate the data into morse and feed it to me translating data to morse cooper what if she never came back for it she will she will murph i can see his car he is coming murph okay i am coming down how do you know because i gave it to her roger morse is dot dot dash dot dot dot dash dot dot dash dot dot dot dash dot dot dash dash dash dash dash dash he came back it was him all the time i did not know it was him dad is gonna save us eureka it is traditional eureka did it work i think it might have how do you know because the bulk beings are closing the tesseract do not you get it yet tars they are not beings they are us what i have been doing for murph they are doing for me for all of us cooper people could not build this no no not yet but one day not you and me but people a civilization that is evolved past the four dimensions we know what happens now mr cooper all right let is take it slow sir nice and easy mr cooper remember you are no spring chicken anymore actually you are years old take it slow sir you were extremely lucky the rangers found you with only minutes left in your oxygen supply where am i cooper station currently orbiting saturn cooper station nice of you to name it after me what the station is not named after you sir it is named after your daughter although she is always maintained just how important you were is she still alive she will be here in a couple weeks she is far too old to be transferring from another station but when she heard that you would been found well this is murphy cooper we are talking about yes it is we will have you checked out of here in a couple days i am sure you will be excited to see what is in store i actually did a paper on you in high school i know all about your life back on earth yeah right if if you will follow me we have got a really good situation for you so when i made my suggestion to miss cooper i was delighted to hear that she thought it was perfect it was just constant just that steady blow of dirt of course i did not speak to her personally we always set the plate upside down glasses or cups whatever it was upside down well my dad was a farmer like everybody else back then there just was not enough food we wore little things little strips of sheet over our nose and mouth so we would not breathe so much of it well it was pretty exciting for me because it was hope i do not care who describes it there is no way for it to be exaggerated it was that bad she did confirm just how much you loved farming she did did she yeah come here home sweet home everything replaced and put back where it hey is this yeah the machine we found out near saturn when we found you yes its power source was shot but we could get you another one yes please settings general settings security settings honesty new setting: percent confirmed additional customization humor: percent confirmed auto self destruct t minus nine let is make that percent sixty percent confirmed knock knock you want is this really what it was like it was never this clean slick i do not care much for this pretending we are back where we started i want to know where we are where we are going mr cooper the family is all in there yeah family yeah they all came out to see her she is been in cryo sleep for almost two years you told them i like farming it was me murph i was your ghost i know people did not believe me they thought that i was doing it all myself but i knew who it was nobody believed me but i knew you would come back how because my dad promised me well i am here now murph i am here no no parent should have to watch their own child die i have my kids here for me now you go where brand she is out there setting up camp alone in a strange galaxy maybe right now she is settling in for the long nap by the light of our new sun in our new home\n"
