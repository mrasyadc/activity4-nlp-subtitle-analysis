someone must have stepped up to run the so called family is that man in this courtroom today could you identify him for us please you win counselor it was me i have a sworn statement from you that this man salvatore maroni is the new head of the falcone crime family maroni he's a fall guy i'm the brains of the organization order permission to treat the witness as hostile granted hostile i'll show you hostile carbon fiber caliber made in china if you wanna kill a public servant mr maroni i recommend you buy american get him out of here but your honor i'm not done we'll never be able to link the gun to maroni so we can't charge him but they're trying to kill you means we're getting to them i'm glad you're so pleased rachel i'm fine by the way come on harvey you're gotham's da you're not getting shot at you're not doing your job right but you know if you said you were rattled we could take the rest of the day off can't i dragged the head of the major crimes unit down here oh jim gordon he's a friend actually try to be nice i hear you got a hell of a right cross it's a shame sal's going to walk yeah well good thing about the mob is they keep giving you second chances lightly irradiated bills fancy stuff for a city cop have help we liaise with various agencies save it gordon i wanna meet him official policy is to arrest the vigilante known as batman on sight what about that floodlight on the top of mcu if you got problems with malfunctioning equipment i suggest you take them up with maintenance counselor i've put every money launderer in gotham behind bars but the mob is still getting its money out i think you and your friend have found the last game in town you're trying to hit them where it hurts their wallets it's bold you gonna count me in in this town the fewer people know something the safer the operation i don't like that you got your own special unit and it's full of cops i investigated at internal affairs if i didn't work with cops you'd investigated while at ia i'd be working alone i don't get political points for being an idealist i do the best i can with what i have you want me to back warrants for search and seizure on five banks without telling me what we're after i can give you the names of the banks well that's a start i'll get you your warrants but i want your trust oh you don't have to sell me dent we all know you're gotham's white knight yeah well i heard they have a different name for me down at mcu i wouldn't know about that in china lau security investments stands for dynamic new growth a joint chinese venture with wayne enterprises will be a powerhouse well mr lau i speak for the rest of the board and mr wayne in expressing our own excitement sir i know mr wayne is curious about how his trust fund gets replenished but frankly this is embarrassing you worry about the diligence mr reese i'll worry about bruce wayne it's done the numbers are solid do them again wouldn't want the trust fund to run out now would we another long night this joint venture was your idea and the consultants love it but i'm not convinced lau's company has grown by percent annually like clockwork his revenue stream must be off the books maybe even illegal okay cancel the deal you already knew just needed a closer look at their books anything else you can trouble me for i need a new suit yeah three buttons is a little ' s mr wayne i'm not talking fashion mr fox so much as function you wanna be able to turn your head sure make backing out of the driveway easier i'll see what i can do took three weeks to get a reservation here i had to tell them i work for the government really health inspector's not afraid to pull strings rachel fancy that yeah bruce fancy that rachel natascha natascha rachel natascha are you the prima prima ballerina for the moscow ballet wow harvey's taking me next week really so you're into ballet bruce this is harvey dent the famous bruce wayne rachel's told me everything about you i certainly hope not let's put a couple tables together i'm not sure that they'll let us oh they should i own the place how could you want to raise children in a city like this well i was raised here i turned out okay is wayne manor in the city limits is the palisades sure you know as our new da you might wanna figure out where your jurisdiction ends i'm talking about the kind of city that idolizes a masked vigilante gotham city is proud of an ordinary citizen standing up for what's right gotham needs heroes like you elected officials not a man who thinks he's above the law who appointed the batman we did all of us who stood by and let scum take control of our city but this is a democracy harvey when their enemies were at the gates the romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city it wasn't considered an honor it was a public service harvey the last man that they appointed to protect the republic was named caesar and he never gave up his power okay fine you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain whoever the batman is he doesn't wanna do this for the rest of his life how could he batman is looking for someone to take up his mantle someone like you mr dent maybe if i'm up to it what if harvey dent is the caped crusader if i were sneaking out every night someone would've noticed by now well i'm sold dent and i'm gonna throw you a fundraiser that's nice but i'm not up for reelection for three years no you don't understand one fundraiser with my pals you'll never need another cent what the hell is this as you're all aware one of our deposits was stolen a relatively small amount million who's stupid enough to steal from us two bit wackjob wears a cheap purple suit and makeup he's not the problem he's a nobody the problem is our money being tracked by the cops thanks to mr maroni's well placed sources we know that police have indeed identified our banks using marked bills and are planning to seize your funds today and since the enthusiastic new da has put all my competitors out of business i'm your only option so what are you proposing moving all deposits to one secure location not a bank where then no one can know but me if the police were to gain leverage over one of you everyone's money would be at stake what stop them getting to you i go to hong kong far from dent's jurisdiction and the chinese will not extradite one of their own how soon can you move the money i already have for obvious reasons i couldn't wait for your permission rest assured your money is safe and i thought my jokes were bad give me one reason why i shouldn't have my boy pull your head off how about a magic trick i'm gonna make this pencil disappear ta da it's it's gone oh and by the way the suit it wasn't cheap you ought to know you bought it sit i want to hear proposition let's wind the clocks back a year these cops and lawyers wouldn't dare cross any of you i mean what happened did your balls drop off hm you see a guy like me a freak damn right a guy like me look listen i know why you choose to have your little ahem group therapy sessions in broad daylight i know why you're afraid to go out at night the batman see batman has shown gotham your true colors unfortunately dent he's just the beginning and as for the television's so called plan batman has no jurisdiction he'll find him and make him squeal i know the squealers when i see them and what do you propose it's simple we uh kill the batman if it's so simple why haven't you done it already if you're good at something never do it for free how much you want uh half you're crazy no i'm not no i'm not if we don't deal with this now soon little gambol here won't be able to get a nickel for his grandma enough from the clown ah ta ta ta let's not blow shit this out of proportion you think you can steal from us and just walk away yeah i'm putting the word out five hundred grand for this clown dead a million alive so i can teach him some manners first all right so listen why don't you give me a call when you wanna start taking things a little more seriously here's my card you're a hard man to reach lau's halfway to hong kong if you'd have asked i could have taken his passport all that was left in the vaults were marked bills they knew we were coming as soon as your office got involved my office you're sitting down there with scum like wuertz and ramirez and you're talking oh yeah i almost had your rookie cold on a racketeering beat don't try and cloud the fact that clearly maroni's got people in your office dent we need lau back but the chinese won't extradite a national under any circumstances if i get him to you can you get him to talk i'll get him to sing we're going after the mob's life savings things will get ugly i knew the risk when i took this job lieutenant how will you get him back any he does that our chinese friends left town before i could tell them the deal was off well i'm sure that you've always wanted to go to hong kong what's wrong with a phone call i think mr lau deserves a more personal touch now for high altitude jumps you're going to need oxygen and stabilizers well i must say compared to your usual requests jumping out of an airplane is pretty straightforward what about getting back into the plane i'd recommend a good travel agent without it landing now that's more like it mr wayne the cia had a program back in the ' s for getting their people out of hot spots called sky hook we could look into that yeah okay now hardened kevlar plates over titanium dipped tri weave fibers for flexibility you'll be lighter faster more agile perhaps you should read the instructions first yeah now there is a tradeoff separation of the plates makes you more vulnerable to knives and gunfire we wouldn't wanna make things too easy now would we how will it hold up against dogs we talking rottweilers or chihuahuas should do fine against cats i found one in arizona a very nice man said he could have it up and running in a week and he takes cash what about the flight crew south korean smugglers they run flights into pyongyang below radar did you think of an alibi oh yes i believe this is your plane sir you look tired alfred you'll be all right without me if you can tell me the russian for apply your own bloody suntan lotion yo gambol somebody here for you they say they've just killed the joker they brought the body so dead that's how about alive you wanna know how i got these scars my father was a drinker and a fiend and one night he goes off crazier than usual mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself he doesn't like that not one bit so me watching he takes the knife to her laughing while he does it he turns to me and he says: why so serious he comes at me with the knife why so serious he sticks the blade in my mouth let's put a smile on that face and why so serious now our operation is small but there is a lot of potential for aggressive expansion so which of you fine gentlemen would like to join our team oh there's only one spot open right now so we're gonna have tryouts make it fast welcome to hong kong mr fox mr lau regrets he is unable to greet you in person today i understand for security purposes i'm gonna have to ask you to check in your mobile of course i must apologize for leaving gotham in the middle of our negotiations this misunderstanding with the gotham police force i couldn't let it threaten my company of course a businessman of your stature will understand and with you here now we can continue well i do appreciate you bringing me out here in such style mr lau but i re we do not allow cell phones in here i'm sorry forgot i had it no i really came to tell you that our business deal has to be put on hold you see we can't afford to be seen to do business with whatever it is you're accused of being i'm sure a businessman of your stature will understand i think mr fox a simple phone call might have sufficed mr wayne didn't want you to think he was deliberately wasting your time just accidentally wasting it that's very good mr lau accidentally very good hey sir there's a better view from the peak tram how's the view from lsi holdings restricted lau is holed up in there good and tight what's this i had r&d work it up sends out a high frequency pulse records the response time for mapping an environment sonar just like a submarine mr wayne like a submarine and the other device it's in place mr wayne good luck look give us the money and we'll talk about making a deal the money is the only reason i'm still alive oh you mean when they find out that you've helped us they're gonna kill you are you threatening my client no i'm just assuming your client's cooperation with this investigation as will everyone no okay enjoy your time in county mr lau wait i won't give you the money but i will give you my clients all of them you were a glorified accountant what could you possibly have on all of them that we could charge i'm good with calculation i handled all their investments one big pot got it one minute rico if they pooled their money we can charge them as one criminal conspiracy charge them with what in a rico case if you can charge one of them with a felony you can charge all of them with it that's great mr lau what kind of details do you have about this communal fund ledgers immunity protection a chartered plane back to hong kong after you testify in open court i'm just curious with all your clients locked up what's gonna happen with all that money like i said i'm good with calculation he can't go to county i'll keep him here in the holding cells what is this gordon your fortress well you trust them over at county i don't trust them here lau stays well i don't know about mr lau's travel arrangements but i'm sure glad he's back put word out we hire the clown he was right we have to fix real problem batman i'm not aware of any participation our boy looks good on the tube you sure you wanna embarrass me in front of my friends oh don't worry they're coming too have a nice trip see you next fall seven hundred twelve counts of extortion eight hundred and forty nine counts of racketeering two hundred and forty six counts of fraud eighty seven counts of conspiracy murder five hundred and twenty seven counts of obstruction of justice how do the defendants plead order in the court five hundred and forty nine criminals at once how did you convince surrillo to hear this farce she shares my enthusiasm for justice after all she is a judge even if you blow enough smoke to get convictions out of surrillo you're gonna set a new record at appeals it won't matter the head guys make bail sure but the midlevel guys they can't they can't afford to be off the streets they'll cut deals that include some jail time think of all you could do with months of clean streets mr mayor you can't no get out both of you sit down the public likes you that's the only reason that this might fly but that means it's on you they're all gonna come after you now and not just the mob politicians journalists cops anyone whose wallet's about to get lighter are you up to it you'd better be because they get anything on you and those criminals are back on the streets followed swiftly by you and me jesus i think your fundraiser will be a great success sir and why do you think i wanna hold a party for harvey dent i assumed it was your usual reason for socializing beyond myself and the scum of gotham's underbelly: to try to impress miss dawes very droll but very wrong actually it's dent police released video footage found concealed on the body sensitive viewers be aware the image is disturbing tell them your name brian douglas and are you the real batman no no no no then why do you dress up like him because he's a symbol that we don't have to be afraid of scum like you yeah you do brian you really do huh yeah so you think batman's made gotham a better place hm look at me look at me you see this is how crazy batman's made gotham you want order in gotham batman must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn't people will die starting tonight i'm a man of my word harvey dent scourge of the underworld scared stiff by the trust fund brigade i'll be back rachel a little liquid courage mr dent thank you alfred right that's right sir rachel talks about you all the time you've known her her whole life not yet sir any psychotic ex boyfriends i should be aware of oh you have no idea i'm sorry that i'm late i'm glad to see that you all got started without me now where is harvey where harvey dent the man of the hour where's rachel dawes she is my oldest friend come here when rachel first told me she was dating harvey dent i had one thing to say: the guy from those god awful campaign commercials i believe in harvey dent yeah nice slogan harvey but it caught rachel's attention and then i started to pay attention to harvey and all that he's been doing as our new da and you know what i believe in harvey dent i believe that on his watch gotham can feel a little safer a little more optimistic look at this face this is the face of gotham's bright future to harvey dent let's hear it for him harvey harvey may not know you well enough to understand you're making fun of him but i do no i meant every word you know that day that you once told me about when gotham would no longer need batman it's coming bruce you can't ask me to wait for that it's happening now harvey is that hero he locked up half of the city's criminals and he did it without wearing a mask gotham needs a hero with a face you can throw a party wayne i'll give you that thanks again you mind if i borrow rachel lieutenant that joker card pinned to the body forensics found three sets of dna any matches all three the dna belongs to judge surrillo harvey dent and commissioner loeb the joker's telling us who he's targeting get a unit over to surrillo's house tell wuertz to find dent protective custody where's the commissioner city hall seal the building no one in or out till i get there got it gordon what are you up to we're secure i want a floor by floor search of the entire building we believe the joker's made a threat against your life these are dangerous people you're not giving me a lot of information even we don't know where you're going take the envelope get in open it it'll tell you where you're headed you can't leave me alone with these people the whole mob's after you and you're worried about these guys compared to this the mob doesn't scare me gordon you're unlikely to discover this for yourself so take my word the police commissioner earns a lot of threats i found the appropriate response to these situations a long time ago them gunning for you makes you see things clearly yeah i bet yeah it makes you think about things you couldn't stand losing about who you wanna spend your life with that's a pretty big commitment not if the mob has their way you get to explain to my wife why i'm late for dinner sir the joker card had traces of your dna on it don't do that all right let's be serious then okay what's your answer i don't have an answer how'd they get my dna somebody with access to your office or house must have lifted a tissue or a glass wait wait well i guess no answer is a no harvey it's someone else isn't it harvey just tell me it's not wayne the guy's a complete f what are you doing oh shit get a medic they've come for him we made it stay hidden good evening ladies and gentlemen we are tonight's entertainment i only have one question: where is harvey dent you know where harvey is you know who he is hands up pretty boy do you know where i can find harvey i need to talk to him just something little huh no what's going on out there wayne oh thank god you've got a panic room hey wait oh you gotta be kidding me you know i'll settle for his loved ones we're not intimidated by thugs you know you remind me of my father i hated my father okay stop well hello beautiful you must be harvey's squeeze hm and you are beautiful you look nervous is it the scars you wanna know how i got them come here hey look at me so i had a wife she was beautiful like you who tells me i worry too much who tells me i ought to smile more who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks hey one day they carve her face and we have no money for surgeries she can't take it i just wanna see her smile again i just want her to know that i don't care about the scars so i stick a razor in my mouth and do this to myself and you know what she can't stand the sight of me she leaves now i see the funny side now i'm always smiling you got a little fight in you i like that then you're gonna love me drop the gun oh sure you just take off your little mask and show us all who you really are hm let her go very poor choice of words are you all right let's not do that again is harvey okay he's safe thank you jim it's over as long as they don't get to lau we've cut off their funds the prosecution's over nobody's standing up in front of a judge while judges and police commissioners are getting blown away what about dent he's got any sense dent's halfway to mex so where do you keep your trash you're due in court i need you alive long enough to get you on the record you can't protect me you can't even protect yourselves you refuse to cooperate you're not coming back here you go to county how long do you calculate you'll last in there targeting me won't get their money i knew the mob wouldn't go down easily but this is different they crossed a line you crossed the line first you squeezed them you hammered them to the point of desperation and in their desperation they turned to a man they didn't fully understand criminals aren't complicated alfred we just need to figure out what he's after with respect master wayne perhaps this is a man you don't fully understand either a long time ago i was in burma and my friends and i were working for the local government they were trying to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders by bribing them with precious stones but their caravans were being raided in a forest north of rangoon by a bandit so we went looking for the stones but in six months we never met anyone who traded with him one day i saw a child playing with a ruby the size of a tangerine the bandit had been throwing them away so why steal them because he thought it was good sport because some men aren't looking for anything logical like money they can't be bought bullied reasoned or negotiated with some men just wanna watch the world burn your name sir eighth and orchard you'll find harvey dent there check the names richard dent patrick harvey harvey dent i need minutes with the scene before your men contaminate it it's because of you these guys are dead detective give us a minute guys that's brick underneath gonna take ballistics off a shattered bullet no fingerprints whatever you're gonna do do it fast because we found his next target he's put it in tomorrow's paper i'm not sure you made it loud enough sir what can i do for you mr reese you wanted me to do the diligence on the lsi holdings deal again well i found some irregularities their ceo is in police custody no not with their numbers with yours applied sciences whole division of wayne enterprises just disappeared overnight i went down to the archives and i started pulling some old files don't tell me you didn't recognize your baby pancaking cop cars on the evening news now you got the entire r&d department burning through cash claiming it's related to cell phones for the army what are you building for him now a rocket ship i want $ million a year for the rest of my life let me get this straight you think that your client one of the wealthiest most powerful men in the world is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands and your plan is to blackmail this person good luck when keep that this is your original scan here it is reengineered and there's the thumbprint he left when he pushed the round in the clip i'll get you a copy mr wayne did you reassign r&d yeah government telecommunications project wasn't aware we had any government contracts you know lucius i'm playing this one pretty close to the chest fair enough with no word from the batman even as they mourn commissioner loeb these cops have to wonder if the joker will make good on his threat in the obituary column of the gotham times to kill the mayor i've checked all the databases there are four possibles cross reference the addresses look for parkside overlooking the parade i got one melvin white randolph apartments aggravated assault moved to arkham twice what do you got on the roof we're tight but frankly there's a lot of windows up here commissioner loeb dedicated his life to law enforcement and to the protection of his community i remember when i first took office and i asked if he wanted to stay on as commissioner and he said he would provided i kept my politics out of his office clearly he was not a man who minced words nor should he have been a number of policies that he enacted as commissioner were unpopular policies that flooded my office with angry calls and letters who's that what happened they took our guns and our uniforms and as we recognize the sacrifice of this man we must remember that vigilance is the price of safety stand by honor guard attention port arms ready aim fire ready aim ready aim stay down don't move mr mayor get him out of here i'll see you later why are you going back get out of here tell me what you know about the joker no i'm sorry barbara jimmy go

yeah second okay harvey where are you where are you i'm where you should be at major crimes i'm trying to deal with all of this mess can i get the fingerprint analysis rachel listen you're not safe there this is gordon's unit gordon's gone he vouched for these men and he's gone the joker's named you next god is there someone is there anyone in this town we can trust bruce we can trust bruce wayne no rachel i know you're his friend but harvey trust me bruce's penthouse is now the safest place in the city then you go straight there don't tell anybody and i'll find you there i love you i want the joker from one professional to another you're trying to scare somebody pick a better spot from this height the fall wouldn't kill me i'm counting on it where is he i don't know where he is he found us he must have friends friends have you met this guy someone knows where he is nobody's gonna tell you nothing they're wise to your act you got rules the joker he's got no rules nobody's gonna cross him for you if you want this guy you got one way but you already know what that is just take off that mask let him come find you or you can let a couple more people get killed while you make up your mind you wanna play games how's that feel you wouldn't i wouldn't you don't think i will you don't think i will no no i wouldn't that's why i'm not gonna leave it up to me heads you get to keep your head tails not so lucky so you wanna tell me about the joker let's go again i don't know anything god don't you're not playing the odds friend let's do it again you'd leave a man's life to chance not exactly his name's schiff thomas he's a paranoid schizophrenic former patient at arkham the kind of mind the joker attracts what do you expect to learn from him the joker killed gordon he's gonna kill rachel you're the symbol of hope i could never be your stand against organized crime is the first legitimate ray of light in gotham in decades if anyone saw this everything would be undone the criminals you arrested would be released and jim gordon will have died for nothing you're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow why no one else will die because of me gotham's in your hands now you can't you can't give in you can't give in harvey called he said batman's gonna turn himself in i have no choice you honestly think that's gonna keep the joker from killing people maybe not but i have enough blood on my hands and i've seen now what i would have to become to stop men like him you once told me that if the day came when i was finished that we'd be together bruce don't make me your one hope for a normal life did you mean it yes bruce if you turn yourself in they're not gonna let us be together logs as well everything anything that could lead back to lucius or rachel people are dying alfred what would you have me do endure master wayne take it they'll hate you for it but that's the point of batman he can be the outcast he can make the choice that no one else can make the right choice no today i found out what batman can't do he can't endure this today you get to say i told you so today i don't want to but i did bloody tell you i suppose they're gonna lock me up as well as your accomplice accomplice i'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea ladies and gentlemen i've called this press conference for two reasons firstly to assure the citizens of gotham that everything that can be done over the joker killings is being done secondly because the batman has offered to turn himself in but let's consider the situation should we give in to this terrorist's demands do we really think he's gonna you'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante than the lives of citizens the batman is an outlaw that's not why we demand he turn himself in we're doing it because we're scared we've been happy to let batman clean up our streets till now things are worse than ever amen yes they are but the night is darkest just before the dawn and i promise you the dawn is coming one day the batman will have to answer for the laws he's broken but to us not to this madman no more dead cops yeah he should turn himself in give us the batman come on where is he so be it take the batman into custody what is he here i am the batman what come on alfred why is he letting harvey do this he went down to the press conference i know he just stood by perhaps both bruce and mr dent believe that batman stands for something more important than the whims of a terrorist miss dawes even if everyone hates him for it that's the sacrifice he's making he's not being a hero he's being something more yeah you're absolutely right letting harvey take the fall for this is not heroic at all you know him better than anyone i do will you give this to him for me when the time is right how will i know it's not sealed goodbye alfred bye rachel i didn't have time to talk this through what are you doing they're transferring me to central holding this is the joker's chance and when he attacks the batman will take him down listen this is too dangerous we get this guy to county he's their problem the streets will be cleared so let's go the convoys stop for no reason i hope you got some moves pal he's using you as bait he doesn't know if he can get the joker he's failed so far how do you know what he's thinking i just do anyway this isn't just about you what about the people depending on you to clean the city up and do it honorably and harvey tell everyone the truth heads i go through with it this is your life you can't leave something like that to chance i'm not you make your own luck hey you wait like everybody else pal what the hell is that obstruction ahead obstruction ahead damn it all units divert down onto lower fifth i repeat exit down exit down lower fifth we'll be like turkeys on thanksgiving jesus come on get us out of here let's go listen we need backup we've got company we got trouble guys lock and load the hell was that these are built for

him has he said anything yet evening commissioner harvey dent never made it home of course not what have you done with him me i was right here who did you leave him with your people assuming of course that they are still your people and not maroni's does it depress you commissioner to know just how alone you really are does it make you feel responsible for harvey dent's current predicament where is

together i meant it but now i'm sure the day won't come when you no longer need batman i hope it does and if it does i will be there but as your friend i'm sorry harvey i'm sorry to let you down if you lose your faith in me please keep your faith in people love now and always rachel prepared a little breakfast very well then alfred yes master wayne did i bring this on her i was meant to inspire good not madness not death you have inspired good but you spat in the faces of gotham's criminals didn't you think there might be casualties things always get worse before they get better but rachel alfred rachel believed in what you stood for what we stand for gotham needs you no gotham needs its true hero and i let that murdering psychopath blow him half to hell which is why for now they're gonna have to make do with you she was gonna wait for me alfred dent doesn't know he can never know what's that it can wait that bandit in the forest in burma did you catch him yes how we burned the forest down he's credible an m&a lawyer from a leading consultancy he says he's waited as long as he can for batman to do the right thing now he's taking matters into his own hands we'll be live at with the true identity of the batman i'm sorry about rachel the doctor says you're in agonizing pain but that you won't accept medication that you're refusing to accept skin grafts remember that name

our chance i want lau alive the joker either way hey jim get a load of this let's take the next caller harvey dent didn't wanna give in to this maniac you think you know better i think that if we could talk to dent today he may feel differently and we wish him a speedy recovery because god knows we need him now you said you were a man of your word oh i am i'm only burning my half all you care about is money this town deserves a better class of criminal and i'm gonna give it to them tell your men they work for me now this is my city they won't work for a freak freak why don't we cut you up into little pieces and feed you to your pooches and then we'll see how loyal a hungry dog really is it's not about money it's about sending a message everything burns who is this i had a vision of a world without batman the mob ground out a little profit and the police tried to shut them down one block at a time and it was so boring i've had a change of heart i don't want mr reese spoiling everything but why should i have all the fun let's give someone else a chance if coleman reese isn't dead in minutes then i blow up a hospital call in every officer tell them to head to their nearest hospital and start evac and search call the transit authority school board prisons get every bus down to a hospital the priority is gotham general wheel everybody out of that place right now you you

hard feelings between us harvey when you and rachel rachel were being abducted i was sitting in gordon's cage i didn't rig those charges your men your plan do i really look like a guy with a plan you know what i am i'm a dog chasing cars i wouldn't know what to do with one if i caught it you know i just do things the mob has plans the cops have plans gordon's got plans you know they're schemers schemers trying to control their little worlds i'm not a schemer i try to show the schemers how pathetic their attempts to control things really are so when i say ah come here when i say that you and your girlfriend was nothing personal you'll know that i'm telling the truth i'm gonna need your weapon what why because my wife's in the hospital yeah that'd be why it's the schemers that put you where you are you were a schemer you had plans and look where that got you police are taking every precaution urging people not to take matters into their hands i just did what i do best i took your little plan and i turned it on itself look what i did to this city with a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets you know what i noticed nobody panics when things go according to plan even if the plan is horrifying if tomorrow i tell the press that like a gangbanger will get shot or a truckload of soldiers will be blowing up nobody panics because it's all part of the plan but when i say that one little old mayor will die well then everyone loses their minds introduce a little anarchy upset the established order and everything becomes chaos i'm an agent of chaos oh and you know the thing about chaos it's fair you live you die now we're talking mr reese that's mr wayne isn't it that was a very brave thing you did trying to catch the light you weren't protecting the van why who's in it

should've did minutes ago we really should stop this fighting otherwise we'll miss the fireworks there won't be any fireworks and here we go what were you trying to prove that deep down everyone's as ugly as you you're alone can't rely on anyone these days you gotta do everything yourself don't we that's okay i came prepared it's a funny world we live in speaking of which you know how i got these scars no but i know how you got these oh you you just couldn't let me go could you this is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object you truly are incorruptible aren't you huh you won't kill me out of some misplaced sense of self righteousness and i won't kill you because you're just too much fun i think you and i are destined to do this forever you'll be in a padded cell forever maybe we could share one you know they'll be doubling up the rate this city's inhabitants are losing their minds this city just showed you that it's full of people ready to believe in good until their spirit breaks completely until they get a good look at the real harvey dent and all the heroic things he's done you didn't think i'd risk losing the battle for gotham's soul in a fistfight with you no you need an ace in the hole mine's harvey what did you do i took gotham's white knight and i brought him down to our level it wasn't hard see madness as you know is like gravity all it takes is a little push dent this is where they brought her gordon after your men handed her over this is where she died i know i was here trying to save her but you didn't i couldn't yes you could've if you'd listened to me if you stood up against corruption instead of doing your deal with the devil i was trying to fight the mob you wouldn't dare try to justify yourself if you knew what i'd lost have you ever had to talk to the person you loved most tell them it's gonna be all right when you know it's not well you're about to know what that feels like gordon then you can look me in the eye and tell me you're sorry you're not going to hurt my family no just the person you love most so is it your wife put the gun down harvey harvey put down the gun please please harvey please oh goddamn it will you stop pointing that gun at my family no we have a winner no jim stop him harvey don't let him harvey i'm sorry for everything please don't hurt my son you brought your cops all they know is there's a situation they don't know who or what they're just creating a perimeter you think i wanna escape from this there is no escape from this you don't wanna hurt the boy harvey it's not about what i want it's about what's fair you thought we could be decent men in an indecent time but you were wrong the world is cruel and the only morality in a cruel world is chance unbiased unprejudiced fair his son's got the same chance she had fifty fifty what happened to rachel wasn't chance we decided to act we three then why was it me who was the only one who lost everything it wasn't the joker chose me because you were the best of us he wanted to prove that even someone as good as you could fall and he was right you're the one pointing the gun harvey so point it at the people responsible fair enough you first my turn harvey you're right rachel's death was my fault please don't punish the boy please punish me i'm about to tell your boy he's gonna be all right gordon lie like i lied

not locked up waiting for the invasion wars are not won by evacuations i can't look but there was a victory inside this deliverance which should be noted our thankfulness at the escape of our army must not blind us to the fact that what has happened in france and belgium is a colossal military disaster we must expect another blow to be struck almost immediately we shall go on to the end we shall fight in france we shall fight on the seas and oceans we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air we shall defend our island whatever the cost what we shall defend our island whatever the cost may be we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the hills we shall never surrender and even if this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving then our empire beyond the seas armed and guarded by the british fleet would carry on the struggle until in god's good time the new world with all its power and might steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old\n"

caretaker generation coop and things are getting better maybe your grandkids will get to be engin are we done here sir no miss hanley's here to talk about murph murph is a great kid she's really bright but she's been having a little trouble lately she brought this in to show the students the section on the lunar landings yeah it's one of my old textbooks she always loved the pictures it's an old federal textbook we've replaced them with the corrected versions corrected explaining how the apollo missions were faked to bankrupt the soviet union you don't believe we went to the moon it was a brilliant piece of propaganda the soviets bankrupted themselves pouring resources into rockets and other useless machines useless machines if we don't want a repeat of the excess and wastefulness of the th century then we need to teach our kids about this planet not tales of leaving it one of those useless machines they used to make was called an mri if we had any of those left the doctors would've been able to find the cyst in my wife's brain before she died instead of afterwards then she'd have been the one listening to this instead of me which would have been a good thing because she was always the calmer one i'm sorry about your wife mr cooper but murph got into a fistfight with several of her classmates over this apollo nonsense so we thought it best to bring you in and see what ideas you might have for dealing with her behavior on the home front yeah you know what there's a game tomorrow night she's going through a bit of a baseball phase her favorite team is playing there's gonna be candy and soda and i think i'll take her to that how'd it go i got you suspended what cooper this is cooper go coop those combines you rebuilt went haywire just reset the controllers i did that now you should come take a look one by one they've been peeling off the fields and heading over something's interfering with the compass magnetism or some such nothing special about which book i've been working on it like you said i counted the spaces why in case the ghost is trying to communicate i'm trying morse morse yeah dots and dashes used i know what morse code is murph i just don't think your bookshelf's trying to talk to you had to reset every compass clock and gps to offset for the anomaly which is i don't know if the house was built on magnetic ore we'd have seen this the first time we switched on the tractor i hear your meeting at the school didn't go so well you heard it's like we've forgotten who we are donald explorers pioneers not caretakers when i was a kid it felt like they made something new every day some gadget or idea like every day was christmas but six billion people just try to imagine that and every last one of them trying to have it all this world isn't so bad and tom will do just fine you're the one who doesn't belong born years too late or years too early my daughter knew it god bless her and your kids know it especially murph well we used to look up in the sky and wonder at our place in the stars now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt cooper you were good at something and you never got a chance to do anything with it i'm sorry you didn't expect this dirt that was giving you this food to turn on you like that and destroy you in april i believe i'm right fifteenth of april i think this happened about : when that thing came off the top of that canyon in my day we had real ballplayers who are these bums in my day people were too busy fighting over food to even play baseball popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural i want a hot dog school says you're gonna follow in my footsteps i think that's great you think that's great you hate farming dad grandpa said grandpa said listen all that matters is how you feel about it i like what you do i like our farm you're gonna be great at it let's get out of here all right it's a doozy all right gang let's mask up tom murph check yeah murph tom you guys shut your windows murph the ghost grab your pillow you're sleeping in with tom it's not a ghost it's gravity i'm dropping tom then heading to town you want to clean that up when you've finished praying to it it's not morse murph it's binary thick is one thin is zero coordinates nope here we go thirty three that's it i can't miss this grandpa will be back in a couple hours murph but you don't know what you're gonna find and that is why i can't take you murph grandpa will be home in a while tell him i'll call him on the radio jesus what are you doing you think this is funny you wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me make yourself useful hey murph murph i think this is the end of the road didn't you bring the bolt cutters that's my girl step away don't shoot i'm not armed my daughter's in the car don't be afraid how did you find this place where's my daughter you had the coordinates for this facility marked on your map where did you get them where's my daughter don't make me take you down again sit down you still think you're a marine pal marines don't exist anymore and i got grunts like you mowing my grass where did you find those coordinates but you don't look much like a lawnmower think i'll turn you into an overqualified vacuum cleaner no you won't tars back down please you know you're taking a risk using ex military security they're old and their control units are unpredictable it's what the government could spare who are you dr brand i knew a dr brand once he was a professor what makes you think i'm not wasn't near as cute either please dr brand i don't have any idea what this is now i'm scared for my daughter and want her by my side you give me that i'll tell you anything you want to know get the principals and the girl in the conference room please your daughter is fine bright kid must have a very smart mother it's pretty clear you don't want any visitors so why don't you just let us back up from your fence and we'll be on our way it's not that simple well sure it is i don't know anything about you i don't know anything about this place yes you do dad hello cooper professor brand explain to me how you found this facility kind of an accident we sort of stumbled upon it we were on a salvage run you're sitting in the best kept secret in the world nobody stumbles in here nobody stumbles out cooper please cooperate with these people look it's kind of hard to explain we learned these coordinates from an anomaly what sort of anomaly i hesitate to term it supernatural but it definitely wasn't scientific you're going to have to be specific mr cooper right now it was gravity what sort of gravitational anomaly where was this now i'm real happy that you're excited about gravity bud but you're not getting any answers from us until i get assurances assurances yeah like that we're getting out of here and i don't mean in the trunk of some car don't you know who we are coop no professor i don't you know my father professor brand we're nasa nasa nasa the same nasa you flew for i heard they shut you down sir for refusing to drop bombs from the stratosphere onto starving people when they realized that killing other people was not a long term solution then they needed us back in secret why secret because public opinion wouldn't allow spending on space exploration not while you're struggling to put food on the table blight wheat seven years ago okra this year now there's just corn and we're growing more than we ever have but like the potatoes in ireland and the wheat in the dust bowl the corn will die soon we'll find a way professor we always have driven by the unshakable faith the earth is ours not just ours no but it is our home earth's atmosphere is percent nitrogen we don't even breathe nitrogen blight does and as it thrives our air gets less and less oxygen the last people to starve will be the first to suffocate and your daughter's generation will be the last to survive on earth murph is tired i was wondering if she could take a nap in my office yeah thank you okay now you need to tell me what your plan is to save the world we're not meant to save the world we're meant to leave it rangers the last components of our one versatile ship in orbit the endurance our final expedition you sent people out there looking for a new home the lazarus missions that sounds cheerful lazarus came back from the dead sure but he had to die in the first place there's not a planet in our solar system that could sustain life and the nearest star's over a thousand years away that doesn't even qualify as futile where'd you send them cooper i can't tell you anymore unless you agree to pilot this craft you're the best pilot we ever had i barely left the stratosphere this team never left the simulator we need a pilot and this is the mission that you were trained for without even knowing it an hour ago you didn't even know i was alive you were going anyway we had no choice but something sent you here they chose you who's they how long would i be gone hard to know years i've got kids professor get out there and save them who's they we started detecting gravitational anomalies almost years ago mostly small distortions to our instruments in the upper atmosphere in fact i believe you encountered one yourself yeah over the straights my crash something tripped my fly by wire exactly but of all these anomalies the most significant is this: out near saturn a disturbance of space time is that a wormhole it appeared years ago and it leads where another galaxy a wormhole's not a naturally occurring phenomenon someone placed it there they and whoever they are they appear to be looking out for us that wormhole lets us travel to other stars it came along right as we needed it they've put potentially habitable worlds right within our reach twelve in fact from our initial probes you sent probes into that we sent people into it ten years ago the lazarus missions twelve possible worlds twelve ranger launches carrying the bravest humans ever to live led by the remarkable dr mann each person's landing pod had enough life support for two years but they could use hibernation to stretch that making observations on organics over a decade or more their mission was to assess their world and if it showed potential then they could send out a signal bed down for the long nap wait to be rescued and what if the world didn't show promise hence the bravery you don't have the resources to visit all no data transmission back through the wormhole is rudimentary simple binary pings on an annual basis give us some clue as to which worlds have potential and one system shows promise one that's a bit of a long shot isn't it one system with three potential worlds no long shot okay so if we find a home then what that's the long shot there's a plan a and a plan b did you notice anything strange about the launch chamber this entire facility's a centrifuge some kind of vehicle a space station both plan a how do you get it off the ground the first gravitational anomalies changed everything suddenly we knew that harnessing gravity was real so i started working on a theory and we started building this station but you haven't solved it yet that's why there's plan b the problem is gravity how to get a viable amount of human life off the planet this is one way plan b: a population bomb over fertilized eggs weighing in at just under kilos how would you raise them with equipment on board we incubate the first after that with surrogacy the growth becomes exponential within years we could have a colony of hundreds the real difficulty with colonization is genetic diversity this takes care of that but what about the people here you just give up on them my kids that's why plan a is a lot more fun how far have you got almost there you're asking me to hang everything on an almost i'm asking you to trust me find us a new home and by the time you return i will have solved the problem of gravity i give you my word go away murph go if you're leaving just go this world was never enough for you was it coop what because heading out there is what i feel like i was born to do and it excites me no that does not make it wrong it might don't trust the right thing done for the wrong reason the why of the thing that's the foundation and the foundation's solid we farmers we sit here every year when the rains fail and we say: next year well next year ain't gonna save us nor the one after that this world's a treasure donald but it's been telling us to leave for a while now mankind was born on earth it was never meant to die here tom will be all right but you got to make things right with murph i will without making promises you don't know you can keep you have to talk to me murph i need to fix this before i go then i'll keep it broken so you have to stay after you kids came along your mom said something to me i never quite understood she said now we're just here to be memories for our kids and i think that now i understand what she meant once you're a parent you're the ghost of your children's future you said ghosts didn't exist that's right murph murph look at me i can't be your ghost right now i need to exist they chose me murph they chose me you saw you're the one who led me to them that's exactly why you can't go i figured out the message one word know what it is murph stay it says stay dad murph you don't believe me look at the books look at this it says stay why you're not listening it says stay no i'm coming back when one for you one for me when i'm up there in hypersleep or traveling near the speed of light or near a black hole time's gonna change for me it's gonna run more slowly when we get back we're gonna compare time will run differently for us yeah by the time i get back we might even be the same age you and me what imagine that aw murph you have no idea when you're coming back no idea at all murph don't don't make me leave like this come on murph don't make me leave like this murph hey i love you forever you hear me i love you forever and i'm coming back i'm coming back how'd it go fine just fine i love you tom travel safe yeah you look after our place for me all right all right hey can i use your truck while you're gone you mean your truck i'll make sure they bring it back look after my kids donald go for main engine start t minus dad nine dad eight seven dad six five main engine start four three two one booster ignition and all engines look good beginning roll program prepare for stage one separation stage one there is mach everybody good plenty of slaves for my robot colony they gave him a humor setting so he'd fit in better with his unit he thinks it relaxes us a giant sarcastic robot what a great idea i have a cue light i can use when i'm joking if you like that'd probably help you can use it to find your way back to the ship after i blow you out the airlock what's your humor setting tars that's percent let's bring it on down to please stage two separation all feeds going manual going manual deactivate probe heater one two and three check taking control this is handover to you a d f check over pull thrusters back fuel cells one two three one hundred percent ex mites it's hard leaving everything my kids your father we're going to be spending a lot of time together we should learn to talk and when not to just being honest i don't think you need to be that honest hey tars what's your honesty parameter ninety percent ninety percent absolute honesty isn't always the most diplomatic nor the safest form of communication with emotional beings okay ninety percent it is dr brand we are coming up on the endurance twelve minutes out okay taking control approaching module port meters it's all you doyle nice and easy doyle nice and easy i feel good take us home lock target locked well done okay helmets on good job door's not charging never mind cooper you should have control control here communication with ring module active that's initiate are we ready to spin just a sec hello case hello tars all right we're all set all right let's do it thirty percent of spin one g how's gravity treating you back there well romilly hey you okay yeah you all right yeah i just need a minute we have some dramamine in the hab pod or maybe in the cryo beds i'll just be a sec hey brand yeah bring a lot amelia be safe give my regards to dr mann i will dad it looks good for your trajectory we've calculated two years to saturn that's a lot of dramamine look after my family will you please sir we'll be waiting for you when you get back a little older a little wiser but happy to see you do not go gentle into that good night old age should burn and rave at close of day rage rage against the dying of the light though wise men at their end know dark is right because their words had forked no lightning they do not go gentle into that good night rage rage against the dying of the light you good yeah okay thank you here pills so alone we have each other dr mann had it worse no i mean them it's a perfect planet and we won't find another one like her no it's not like looking for a new condo the human race is going to be adrift desperate for a rock it can cling to while it catches its breath we need to find that rock and our three prospects are at the edge of what might sustain human life laura miller's planet is first laura started our biology program wolf edmunds is here tell me about edmunds wolf's a particle physicist none of them had families no no attachments my father insisted they all knew the odds against ever seeing another human being again i'm hoping we can surprise at least three of them how about mann dr mann he's remarkable he's the best of us he inspired people to follow him on the loneliest journey in human history scientists explorers that's what i love you know out there we face great odds death but not evil you don't think nature can be evil no formidable frightening but no not evil is a lion evil because it rips a gazelle to shreds just what we take with us then yeah this crew represents the best of humanity even me you know what we agreed percent there you go don't stay up i'll be there in a minute just remember coop you are literally wasting your breath hey tars let's go over that trajectory one more time eight months to mars counter orbital slingshot around fourteen months to saturn nothing's changed on that just let me ask you something dr brand and edmunds why are you whispering they can't hear you dr brand and edmunds they close i wouldn't know is that percent wouldn't know or percent wouldn't know i also have a discretion setting cooper but not a poker face slick hey guys dad's about to go down for the long nap so i wanted to give you an update the earth looks amazing from here you can't see any of the dust i really hope you guys are doing great i know you'll get this message professor brand's assured me he'll get it to you know that i love you is it him i don't think so murph you must be donald hello murph why are you in my dad's truck he wanted me to bring it for your brother he sent you a message she's pretty upset with him for leaving if you record any messages i can get them to transmit it to cooper murph is a bright spark maybe i should fan the flame she's already making fools of her teachers so maybe she should come and make a fool out of you so where are they heading for mars the next time you hear from cooper they'll be coming up on saturn as far as school goes the administration wants me to repeat plant pathology which sucks but they said i could start advanced agriculture a year early all right i got to go dad hope you're safe up there sorry coop i asked murph to say hi but she's as stubborn as her old man i'll try again next time you all right rom this gets to me cooper this this millimeters of aluminum that's it and then nothing out there for millions of miles won't kill us in seconds you know that some of the finest solo yachtsmen in the world don't know how to swim they don't know how and if they go overboard they're done we're explorers rom this is our boat here this is from the relay probe it was in orbit around the wormhole this is the wormhole and every time we'd come around we would receive images from the other side of the foreign galaxy yeah like swinging a periscope around exactly so we got a pretty good idea what we're gonna find on the other side navigationally guys we'll be approaching the wormhole in about three hours hey coop can we stop the spinning why because we're close enough to see it now all right thanks there that's it that's the wormhole say it don't spray it rom it's a sphere of course it is what you you thought it would just be a hole no it's just that all the illustrations i've ever seen they in the illustrations they're trying to show you how it works so they say you want to go from here to there but it's too far right so a wormhole bends space like this so you can take a shortcut through a higher dimension okay so to show that they've turned three dimensional space into two dimensions which turns a wormhole into two dimensions a circle what's a circle in three dimensions a sphere exactly a spherical hole but who put it there who do we have to thank i'm not thanking anybody until we get out of here in one piece rom any trick to this doyle no one knows the others made it right at least some of them everybody ready to say goodbye to our solar system to our galaxy here we go the controls won't work here we're passing through the bulk it's space beyond our three dimensions all you can do is record and observe what is that i think it's them distorting space time don't don't what was that the first handshake we're we're here so the lost communications came through how the relay on this side cached them so years of basic data no real surprises miller's site has kept pinging thumbs up as has dr mann's edmunds' went down three years ago transmitter failure maybe he was sending the thumbs up right until it went dark but miller's still looks good though right because she's coming up fast with one complication the planet is much closer to gargantua than we thought gargantua it's what we're calling the black hole miller's and dr mann's planets both orbit it and miller's is on the horizon as a basketball around a hoop landing there takes us dangerously close and a black hole that big has a huge gravitational pull look i could swing around that neutron star to decelerate no it's not that it's time the gravity on that planet will slow our clock compared to earth's drastically how bad every hour we spend on that planet will be seven years back on earth jesus well that's relativity folks well we can't just drop down there without cooper we have a mission yeah doyle we have a mission and our mission plan a is to find a planet that can habitate the people that are living on earth now you can't just think about your family now you have to think bigger i am thinking about my family and millions of other families okay plan a does not work if the people on earth are dead by the time we pull it off no it doesn't that's why there's a plan b okay cooper's right we need to think of time as a resource like oxygen and food going down will cost us all right look dr mann's data is promising but it will take months to get there and edmunds' it's even further miller hasn't sent much but what she has is very promising it's water it's organics you don't find that every day no you don't and just think about the resources including time that would be spent trying to get back here romilly yeah how far off from miller's planet do we have to be to stay out of the time shift just back from the cusp all right which is here just outside of miller's planet right okay here's gargantua here's miller's planet instead of taking the endurance into orbit around miller's planet which would conserve fuel but we would lose a lot of time what if we take a wider orbit around gargantua parallel with miller's planet outside of this time shift to here then we take the ranger down we get miller we get her samples we come back we analyze we debrief we're in we're out we lose a little fuel but we save a whole lot of time that'll work that's good there's no time for monkey business or chit chat down there so tars you should definitely stay here case you're with me anyone else can stay if we're talking about a couple years i could use the time to research gravity observations from the wormhole that's gold to professor brand tars factor an orbit of gargantua conserve fuel minimize thrusting but make sure we stay in range of miller's planet you got it i wouldn't leave you behind dr brand you ready case yup you don't say much do you tars talks plenty for both of us detach romilly are you reading these forces it's unbelievable a literal heart of darkness if we could just see the collapsed star inside the singularity yeah we'd solve gravity and we can't get anything from it nothing escapes that horizon not even light the answer's there just no way to see it there's miller's planet goodbye ranger this is fast for atmospheric entry should we use the thrusters to slow no i'm gonna use the ranger's aerodynamics to save some fuel air brake we want to get down fast don't we we want to get there in one piece hang on brand doyle get ready we should ease hands where i can see them the only time i went down was when a machine was easing at the wrong time a little caution can get you killed like reckless driving cooper it's too damn fast i got this should i disable the feedback no i need to feel the air here we go it's just water the stuff of life twelve hundred meters do we have a fix on the beacon got it can you maneuver i'll need to shave some speed i'm gonna spiral down on top of it everybody hang on seven hundred on my cue case on my cue five hundred meters fire very graceful no but very efficient what are you waiting for let's go go go go seven years per hour here let's make it count this way about meters the gravity's punishing been floating through space too long one hundred and thirty percent earth gravity come on come on there's nothing here should be right here if the signal's coming from here then her beacon wreckage where's the rest towards the mountains those aren't mountains they're waves oh shit oh shit oh shit that one's moving away from us we need the recorder brand doyle back to the ranger now we're not leaving without her data get back here now we do not have time the second wave is coming we're in the middle of a swell no i got it get your ass back to the ranger now brand get back here now no cooper go cooper go i can't make it go case go get her go get up get up brand go go go i'm not gonna make it yes you are yes you are come on case has her get back here doyle come on get to the hatch go go go shit manually overriding inside hatch cooper wait the engines are flooded i'm gonna have to shut her down holy shit hang on case what's the problem too waterlogged let it drain goddamn it i told you to leave me why didn't you and i told you to get your ass back here one of us was thinking about the mission you were thinking about getting home i was trying to do the right thing can you tell that to doyle case how much time forty five to an hour the stuff of life what's this gonna cost us brand a lot decades what happened to miller judging by the wreckage she was broken up by a wave soon after impact how's the wreckage stayed together after all these years because of the time slippage on this planet's time she just landed hours ago she probably just died minutes ago the data doyle received was just the initial status echoing endlessly we are not prepared for this you eggheads have the survival skills of a boy scout troop well we got this far on our brains farther than any human in history well not far enough and now we're stuck here till there won't be anyone left on earth to save i'm counting every minute same as you cooper is there any possibility some kind of a way we can maybe all jump in a black hole gain back the years don't shake your head at me time is relative okay it can stretch and it can squeeze but it can't run backwards it just can't the only thing that can move across dimensions like time is gravity okay the beings that led us here they communicate through gravity right yes could they be talking to us from the future maybe okay if they can they are beings of five dimensions to them time might be another physical dimension to them the past might be a canyon that they can climb into and the future a mountain they can climb up but to us it's not okay look cooper i screwed up i'm sorry but you knew about relativity brand my daughter was years old i couldn't teach her einstein's theories before i left couldn't you have told her you were going to save the world no when you become a parent one thing becomes really clear and that is that you want to make sure your children feel safe and it rules out telling a year old that the world is ending cooper how long for the engines case a minute or two we don't have it helmets on brand co pilot you're up case blow the cabin oxygen through the main thrusters we're gonna spark it roger that locked depressurizing engines up hello rom i've waited years how how many years by now it must be twenty three years four months eight days doyle i thought i was prepared i knew the theory reality's different and miller there's nothing here for us why didn't you sleep i had a couple of stretches but i stopped believing you were coming back and something seemed wrong about dreaming my life away i learned what i could from the black hole but i couldn't send anything to your father we've been receiving but nothing gets out is he alive yeah yeah yeah we've got years of messages stored cooper messages span years play it from the beginning hey dad checking in saying hi finished second in school miss kurling's still giving me c's though pulled me down but second's not bad grandpa attended the ceremony i met another girl dad i i really think this is the one name's lois that's her right there murphy stole grandpa's car she crashed it she's okay though hey dad look at this you're a grandpa his name's jesse i kind of wanted to call him coop but lois says maybe next time donald says he's already earned the great part so we just leave it at that oh dear oh dear say bye bye grandpa bye bye grandpa okay sorry it's been a while just what with jesse and all grandpa died last week we buried him out in the back forty next to mom and jesse which is where we would have buried you if you'd ever come back murph was there at the funeral we don't see her that much but she came for that you aren't listening to this i know that all these messages are just like drifting out there in the darkness lois says that i have to let you go and so i guess i'm letting you go i don't know where you are dad but i hope that you're at peace goodbye hey dad hey murph you son of a bitch i never made one of these when you were still responding because i was so mad at you for leaving and then when you went quiet it seemed like i should live with that decision and i have but today's my birthday and it's a special one because you told me you once told me that when you came back we might be the same age and today i'm the age you were when you left so it would be a real good time for you to come back i didn't mean to intrude it's just that i've never seen you in here before i've never been in here before i talk to amelia all the time it helps i'm glad you've started i haven't i i just had something i needed to get out i know they're still out there i know there are so many reasons their communications might not be getting through i know professor i'm not sure what i'm more afraid of them never coming back or coming back to find we've failed then let's succeed so back to the fourth iteration let's run it through some new fields with respect professor we've tried that hundreds of times it only has to work once murph every rivet that they strike could have been a bullet we've done well for the world here whether or not we crack the equation before i kick the bucket don't be morbid professor i'm not afraid of death i'm an old physicist i'm afraid of time time you're afraid of time we've been trying to solve the equation without changing the underlying assumption about time and and that means each iteration is an attempt to prove its own proof it's recursive it's nonsensical are you calling my life's work nonsense murph no i'm saying that you've been trying to finish it with one arm no with both arms tied behind your back and i don't understand why i'm an old man murph can we take this point up at another time i want to talk to my daughter stepping out into the universe we must confront the reality of interstellar travel we must reach far beyond our own lifespans we must think not as individuals but as a species do not go gentle into that good night tars kept the endurance right where we needed her but the trip took years longer than we anticipated we no longer have the fuel to visit both prospects so we have to choose but how they're both promising edmunds' data is better but dr mann is the one still transmitting so we've no reason to suspect edmunds's data would have soured his world has key elements to sustain human life as does dr mann's cooper this is my field and i really believe edmunds' is the better prospect why gargantua that's why look at miller's planet hydrocarbons organics yes but no life sterile we'll find the same thing on mann's because of the black hole murphy's law whatever can happen will happen accident is the first building block of evolution but when you're orbiting a black hole not enough can happen it sucks in asteroids and comets other events which would otherwise reach you we need to go further afield you once said that dr mann was the best of us he's remarkable we're only here because of him and yet yet here he is he's on the ground and he's sending a very unambiguous message telling us to come to his planet granted but edmunds' data is more promising we should vote well if we vote there's something you should know brand he has a right to know that has nothing to do with it what does she's in love with wolf edmunds is that true yes and that makes me want to follow my heart but maybe we've spent too long trying to figure all this out with theory you're a scientist brand so listen to me when i say that love isn't something we invented it's observable powerful it has to mean something love has meaning yes social utility social bonding child rearing we love people who have died where's the social utility in that none maybe it means something more something we can't yet understand maybe it's some evidence some artifact of a higher dimension that we can't consciously perceive i'm drawn across the universe to someone i haven't seen in a decade who i know is probably dead love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space maybe we should trust that even if we can't understand it yet all right cooper yes the tiniest possibility of seeing wolf again excites me that doesn't mean i'm wrong honestly amelia it might tars chart a course for dr mann's we'll lose about a third again but next year next year i'm gonna work nelson's farm and we'll make it up what happened to nelson murph would you like some more soufflã© oh no i'm full thanks it was delicious coop finish your fritter please will you spend the night your room is exactly as you left it it's ready i need to get back my sewing machine is in there but there's plenty i need to too many memories we might have something for that hey coop the dust lois i have a friend who could look at his lungs amelia i'm sorry you were just being objective unless you're punishing me for screwing up on miller's planet no this wasn't a personal decision if you're wrong you will have a very personal decision to make your fuel calculations are based on a return journey strike out on mann's planet and we'll have to decide whether to return home or push on to edmunds' with plan b starting a colony could save us from extinction you might have to decide between seeing your children again and the future of the human race i trust you'll be as objective then he's been asking for you since he came to we were trying to reach you murph i'm here professor i let you all down no you got us so far real close i'll finish what you started good good murph you had faith all those all those years i i asked you to have faith i wanted you to believe that your father would come back i do professor forgive me murph there's nothing to forgive i i lied murph i lied to you there was no need for him to to come back there is no way to help us but plan a all this all these people and the equation did my father know did he leave me do not go gentle no no you can't leave you no dr brand i'm sorry to tell you that your father died today he had no pain he was at peace i'm very sorry for your loss brand did you know he told you right you knew this was all a sham you left us here to suffocate to starve frozen cloud it's okay it's okay it's okay pray you never learn just how good it can be to see another face i hadn't a lot of hope to begin with but after so long i had none my supplies were completely exhausted the last time i went to sleep i didn't even set a waking date you have literally raised me from the dead lazarus what about the others i'm afraid you're it sir so far surely no our present situation is that there's very little chance of rescuing any others dr mann dr mann tell us about your world our world we hope our world is cold stark but undeniably beautiful the days are hours long cold the nights are far colder hours the gravity is a very very pleasant percent of the earth's now up here where i landed the water is alkali and the air has too much ammonia to breathe for more than just a few minutes but down at the surface and there is a surface the chlorine dissipates the ammonia gives way to crystalline hydrocarbons and breathable air to organics possibly even to life we might be sharing this world these readings are from the surface over the years i've dropped various probes how far have you explored i've mounted several major expeditions but with oxygen in limited supply kipp there really did most of the legwork what went wrong with him sir degeneration he misidentified the first organics we found as ammonia crystals we struggled on for a time but ultimately i decommissioned him and used his power source to keep the mission going i thought i was alone before i shut him down would you like me to look at him no no he needs a human touch dr brand case is relaying a message for you from the comm station okay be right there excuse me dr brand i'm sorry to tell you that your father died today he had no pain he was at peace i'm sorry for your loss is that murph she's she's grown brand did you know he told you right you knew this was all a sham you left us here to suffocate to starve did my father know too dad i just want to know if you left me here to die i just have to know cooper my my father dedicated his whole life to plan a i have no idea what she's talking about i do he never even hoped to get the people off the earth no but he's been trying to solve the gravity equation for years amelia your father solved his equation before i even left then why wouldn't he use it the equation couldn't reconcile relativity with quantum mechanics you need more more more what more data you need to see into a black hole the laws of nature prohibit a naked singularity romilly is that true if a black hole is an oyster then the singularity's the pearl inside the gravity's so strong it's always hidden in darkness behind the horizon that's why we call it a black hole okay but if we see beyond the horizon we can't coop there are some things that aren't meant to be known your father had to find another way to save the human race from extinction plan b a colony why not tell people why keep building those stations he knew how hard it would be to get people to work together to save the species instead of themselves or their children bullshit you never would've come unless you believed you would save them evolution has yet to transcend that simple barrier we can care deeply selflessly about those we know but that empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight but the lie that monstrous lie unforgivable and he knew that he was prepared to destroy his own humanity in order to save the species he made an incredible sacrifice no an incredible sacrifice is being made by the people on earth who are gonna die because in his fucking arrogance he declared their case hopeless i'm sorry cooper their case is hopeless no no we are the future cooper what can i do let me go home you're absolutely positive his solution was correct he'd had it for years it's worthless it's half the answer okay how do you find the other half out there a black hole but stuck down here on earth yeah i'm not sure you can god they just pack up and leave what are they hoping to find survival damn it murph don't don't people have a right to know panic won't help we just have to keep working same as ever but isn't that exactly what professor brand was manipulating us to do brand gave up on us i'm still trying to solve this so do you have an idea a feeling i told you about my ghost my dad thought i called it a ghost because i was scared of it but i was never scared of it i called it a ghost because it felt it felt like a person it was trying to tell me something if there's an answer here on earth it's back there somehow in that room so i have to find it we're running out of time what about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers no they can stay i'll be sleeping anyway hey coop yeah i have a suggestion for your return journey yeah what's that have one last crack at the black hole i'm going home rom yeah i know this isn't going to cost you any time there's a chance for the people on earth talk to me gargantua's an older spinning black hole it's what we call a gentle singularity gentle they're hardly gentle but the tidal gravity is so quick that something crossing the horizon fast might survive a probe say what happens after it crosses after the horizon is a complete mystery so what's to say there isn't some way that the probe can glimpse the singularity and relay the quantum data if he's equipped to transmit every form of energy that can pulse just when did this probe become a he professor tars is the obvious candidate i've already told him what to look for i'd need the old optical transmitter off kipp cooper you'd do this for us before you get all teary remember that as a robot i have to do anything you say your cue light's broken i'm not joking i'll need tars to remove and adapt some components from kipp i don't want to disturb his archival functions i'll supervise all right dr mann we need to find three secure sites one for brand's lab two for habitat once those modules have landed you don't want to move them i can take you to the probe sites but i don't think these conditions will hold i think we should wait case is headed down with the rest of the distillery equipment i'd really like to secure those sites by nightfall well these squalls do usually blow over okay then you'll need a long range transmitter got it are you charged yeah follow me tars hours yeah roger that cooper brand told me why you feel you have to go back but i'd be remiss if i didn't at least mention that a mission such as ours could certainly use an extra engineer you better slow down turbo safety first case remember safety first cooper i have to tell you dr mann i'm honored to be a part of this but once we set up base camp and secure those modules my work's done here i'm going home you have attachments but even without a family i can promise you that that yearning to be with other people is powerful that emotion is at the foundation of what makes us human it's not to be taken lightly how long have you had that cough a while mom lets me play in here i don't touch your stuff just take this gently you know why we couldn't just send machines on these missions don't you a machine doesn't improvise well because you can't program a fear of death our survival instinct is our single greatest source of inspiration take you for example a father with a survival instinct that extends to your kids what does research tell us is the last thing you're going to see before you die your children their faces at the moment of death your mind's gonna push a little bit harder to survive for them deep breath hey i bet you're coop why don't you have a seat here for me it's bad they cannot stay here okay yeah tars what's taking so long professor i am having trouble completing the boot up i don't understand it's funny when i left earth i thought i was prepared to die the truth is i never really considered the possibility that my planet wasn't the one nothing worked out the way it was supposed to let's go all right buddy give me a big deep breath what is this what are you doing i'm sorry i can't let you leave with that ship we're gonna need it to complete the mission once the others realize what this place isn't we cannot survive here i'm sorry i'm sorry they can't stay here anymore you have to leave right now let me make something abundantly clear you have a responsibility jesus coop get her stuff she's going home dad didn't raise you to be this dumb tom dad didn't raise me grandpa did and he's buried out back with mom and jesse you faked all the data yeah there's no surface no i tried to do my duty cooper but i knew the day that i arrived here that this place had nothing and i resisted the temptation for years but i knew that if i just pressed that button then somebody would come and save me you fucking coward yes yes yes yes listen if you're not going to go let your family go just save your family and we go live underground with you pray that daddy comes to save us dad's not coming back he never was coming back it's up to me you're gonna save everybody because dad couldn't do it dad didn't even try dad just abandoned us he left us here to die nobody's going with you you gonna wait for your next kid to die get out and don't come back you can keep my stuff stop it no no dr mann there's a chance you're gonna kill yourself those are the best odds i've had in years don't judge me cooper you were never tested like i was few men have been you tried your best murph you're feeling it aren't you the survival instinct that's what drove me it's what drives all of us and it's what's gonna save us because i want to save all of us for you cooper i'm sorry i can't watch you go through this i'm sorry i thought i could but i can't i'm here i'm here for you just listen to my voice cooper i'm right here you're not alone do you see your children it's okay they're right there with you did professor brand tell you that poem before you left do you remember do not go gentle into that good night old age should burn and rave at close of day rage rage against the dying of the light brand help help cooper case no air ammonia cooper cooper we're coming case i have a fix go go go go and away cooper we're coming hang in there don't talk try to breathe as little as possible we're almost there there's a security lockout sir it requires a person to access function it's all yours sir try not to breathe we're coming we're coming right now case come on come on we got to go faster case faster faster faster hang in there come on i see him i see him case bank bank right cooper cooper i'm here this data makes no sense i'm sorry what mann was lying go go romilly romilly romilly do you read me romilly step back professor step back romilly romilly do you read me keep watch lois what happened to caution case safety first cooper romilly romilly do you read me this is brand romilly dr brand cooper there's been an explosion dr mann's compound tars tars o'clock let me know when tars is aboard romilly did not survive i could not save him tars is in i'll take her now do we have a fix on the ranger he's pushing into orbit if he takes control of that ship we're dead he'd maroon us he is marooning us i'll meet you guys downstairs go wait by the car come on give me your bag get in the backseat get in the backseat now dr mann please respond dr mann please respond he doesn't know the endurance docking procedure the autopilot does not since tars disabled it nice what's your trust setting tars lower than yours apparently do not attempt docking i repeat do not attempt docking please res auto docking sequence withheld override unauthorized override unauthorized do not attempt docking i repeat do not attempt docking please resp moving slowly toward the endurance imperfect contact override hatch lockout is he locked on yet imperfectly dr mann do not hatch lockout disengaged dr mann do not i repeat do not open the hatch i repeat do not open the hatch if you open the hatch the airlock will depressurize what happens if he blows the airlock nothing good okay pull back retro thrusters everything we've got case thrusters are full back relay my transmission to the on board computer and have it rebroadcast as emergency p a dr mann i repeat do not open the inner hatch i repeat brand i don't know what he said to you but i am taking command of the endurance and then we can talk about completing the mission dr mann listen to me this is not about my life or cooper's life this is about all mankind there is a moment it is not sa oh my god there's no point using fuel to chase analyze the endurance's spin cooper what are you doing docking endurance rotation is rpm okay get ready to match our spin with the retro thrusters it's not possible no it's necessary endurance is hitting stratosphere she's got no heat shield case you ready ready cooper this is no time for caution case if i black out you take the stick tars get ready to engage the docking mechanism endurance is starting to heat twenty feet out i need three degrees starboard cooper ten feet out cooper we are lined up initiating spin come on tars come on tars we are locked cooper locked easing up easy easy retro thrusters main engines on pushing out of orbit come on baby killing main engines okay we're out of orbit okay and for our next trick it'll have to be good we're heading into gargantua's pull oh shit case take the stick roger that cooper we're slipping towards gargantua shall i use main engines no we got to let her slide as far as we can give it to me there's good news there's bad news yeah i've heard that one tars give it to me straight the backup generator kicked in so the system's stable they're all good good okay the navigational hub has been completely destroyed we don't have enough life support to make it back to earth but we can scratch our way to edmunds' planet what about fuel not enough but i have a plan we let gargantua pull us down close to her horizon then a powered slingshot around launching us towards edmunds' planet manually that's what i'm here for i'm gonna take us just inside the critical orbit what about time slippage neither of us has time to worry about relativity right now dr brand i'm sorry cooper once we've gathered enough speed around gargantua we use lander and ranger as rocket boosters to push us out of the black hole's gravity the lander's linkages have been destroyed so we'll have to control manually once lander is spent tars will detach and get sucked into that black hole why does tars have to detach we have to shed the weight to escape the gravity newton's third law the only way humans have ever figured out of getting somewhere is to leave something behind cooper you can't ask tars to do this for us he's a robot so you don't have to ask him to do anything cooper you asshole sorry you broke up a little bit there it's what we intended dr brand it's our only chance to save people on earth if i can find a way to transmit the quantum data i'll find in there they might still make it let's just hope there's still someone there to save maximum velocity achieved prepare to fire escape thrusters ready ready ready main engine ignition in three two one mark come on baby lander engines on my mark three two one mark ranger engines on my mark three two one mark fire this little maneuver's gonna cost us years you don't sound so bad for pushing lander prepare to detach on my mark three two one mark detach goodbye tars goodbye dr brand see you on the other side coop see you there slick okay case nice reckless flying learned from the master ranger prepare to detach what no no cooper what are you doing newton's third law you got to leave something behind you told me we had enough resources for both of us we agreed amelia percent don't detach okay i am nosing down approaching the event horizon portside dipping down beneath it to go through it heading towards blackness i have a visual of the event it's all black tars do you read me it's all blackness tars do you read me over okay screens getting interference losing control of the stick i got flashes flashes of lightness and blackness the turbulence in the gravity is increasing the computers are going down gravitational pull i'm losing control of the stick murph murph come on eject eject eject eject eject eject murph murph murph murph murph no no no murph murph no no if you're leaving just go no no no no don't go don't go you idiot don't go morse morse morse dot dot s t a dash dash dash murph murph we don't have time for this come on y stay come on come on murph come on what's it say what's it say murph what's it say stay tell him murph make him stay make him stay murph make him stay murph don't let me leave murph don't let me leave murph no no no it was you you were my ghost cooper cooper come in cooper tars roger that you survived somewhere in their fifth dimension they saved us yeah who the hell is they and just why would they want to help us i don't know but they constructed this three dimensional space inside their five dimensional reality to allow you to understand it yeah that ain't working yes it is you've seen that time is represented here as a physical dimension you have worked out that you can exert a force across space time gravity to send a message affirmative gravity can cross the dimensions including time apparently do you have the quantum data roger i have it i am transmitting it on all wavelengths but nothing is getting out cooper i can do this i can do this but such complicated data to a child not just any child what else come on dad murph the fire's out come on even if you communicate it here she won't understand its significance for years i get that tars but we've got to figure something out or the people on earth are gonna die think cooper they didn't bring us here to change the past say that again they didn't bring us here to change the past no they didn't bring us here at all we brought ourselves tars give me the coordinates for nasa in binary in binary roger feeding data it's not a ghost it's gravity don't you get it yet tars i brought myself here we're here to communicate with the three dimensional world we're the bridge i thought they chose me but they didn't choose me they chose her for what cooper to save the world all of this is one little girl's bedroom every moment it's infinitely complex they have access to infinite time and space but they're not bound by anything they can't find a specific place in time they can't communicate that's why i'm here i'm gonna find a way to tell murph just like i found this moment how cooper love tars love it's just like brand said my connection with murph it is quantifiable it's the key what are we here to do find how to tell her the watch the watch that's it we code the data into the movement of the second hand tars translate the data into morse and feed it to me translating data to morse cooper what if she never came back for it she will she will murph i can see his car he's coming murph okay i'm coming down how do you know because i gave it to her roger morse is dot dot dash dot dot dot dash dot dot dash dot dot dot dash dot dot dash dash dash dash dash dash he came back it was him all the time i didn't know it was him dad's gonna save us eureka it's traditional eureka did it work i think it might have how do you know because the bulk beings are closing the tesseract don't you get it yet tars they're not beings they're us what i've been doing for murph they're doing for me for all of us cooper people couldn't build this no no not yet but one day not you and me but people a civilization that's evolved past the four dimensions we know what happens now mr cooper all right let's take it slow sir nice and easy mr cooper remember you're no spring chicken anymore actually you are years old take it slow sir you were extremely lucky the rangers found you with only minutes left in your oxygen supply where am i cooper station currently orbiting saturn cooper station nice of you to name it after me what the station isn't named after you sir it's named after your daughter although she's always maintained just how important you were is she still alive she'll be here in a couple weeks she is far too old to be transferring from another station but when she heard that you'd been found well this is murphy cooper we're talking about yes it is we'll have you checked out of here in a couple days i'm sure you'll be excited to see what's in store i actually did a paper on you in high school i know all about your life back on earth yeah right if if you'll follow me we've got a really good situation for you so when i made my suggestion to miss cooper i was delighted to hear that she thought it was perfect it was just constant just that steady blow of dirt of course i didn't speak to her personally we always set the plate upside down glasses or cups whatever it was upside down well my dad was a farmer like everybody else back then there just wasn't enough food we wore little things little strips of sheet over our nose and mouth so we wouldn't breathe so much of it well it was pretty exciting for me because it was hope i don't care who describes it there is no way for it to be exaggerated it was that bad she did confirm just how much you loved farming she did did she yeah come here home sweet home everything replaced and put back where it hey is this yeah the machine we found out near saturn when we found you yes its power source was shot but we could get you another one yes please settings general settings security settings honesty new setting: percent confirmed additional customization humor: percent confirmed auto self destruct t minus nine let's make that percent sixty percent confirmed knock knock you want is this really what it was like it was never this clean slick i don't care much for this pretending we're back where we started i want to know where we are where we're going mr cooper the family's all in there yeah family yeah they all came out to see her she's been in cryo sleep for almost two years you told them i like farming it was me murph i was your ghost i know people didn't believe me they thought that i was doing it all myself but i knew who it was nobody believed me but i knew you'd come back how because my dad promised me well i'm here now murph i'm here no no parent should have to watch their own child die i have my kids here for me now you go where brand she's out there setting up camp alone in a strange galaxy maybe right now she's settling in for the long nap by the light of our new sun in our new home\n"
